       "  'text': 'The four pillars of our research strategy: rigour, relevance, reach and responsibility \\nWe are an academic business school – which means we strive for rigour and relevance. At the same time, we engage stakeholders to create synergies between our research and learning activities, and we want to have a positive impact on society. \\nRigour underpins our academic credibility. It points to our use of academic models, our accuracy, our doctoral work and the work we publish in high-level academic journals. This rigour sets us apart from consulting companies and other business educators. \\nRelevance shows our research starts and ends with real, substantiated challenges faced by the business world and society as a whole. \\nReach is about the way we communicate and share our research results – and its usefulness in solving real business challenges. We make our research output as visible as possible. \\nResponsibility means we want our research to have a positive impact on society and to be conducted according to the highest ethical standards.\\nWe’re engaged in both fundamental academic research and research for business and society. \\nThese two focal points are interdependent. Our doctoral research, for example, should have broader business application. At the same time, our joint research with companies is based on the rigour of sound academic practice. \\nThis makes our research for business approach unique. Via our research centres and long-standing partnerships and memberships, we create truly practical relevance for the business community. \\nInterdisciplinary research is becoming ever-more important in finding answers to today’s business challenges. Because of this, we join forces across our own domains – and with external international faculty and with faculty from our parent universities in Ghent and Leuven. \\nWe then integrate knowledge gained from solid research into our teaching activities, by developing tools, business games and simulations. \\nThe need for sound academic practice is also something we instil in our students – with critical reflection and business research methodology being essential components of their projects. \\nThe Vlerick research charter \\nResearch for its own sake is out of the question at Vlerick. Our research is based on four principles: It must be accurate, relevant, responsible and have a broad impact. \\nTo make sure our research strategy is widely supported within the school, we’ve created the Vlerick Research Charter. It sets out the ways we work to produce credible research. It safeguards our robust academic practices – and it provides a framework for academic integrity and ethics. All faculty, researchers and DBA participants sign our charter as a commitment to adhere to its principles of sound academic conduct. \\nAnd of course, as an institute, we take responsibility for creating an environment that supports and stimulates sound academic practice with training, mentorship, necessary infrastructure and guidelines. \\nWe support the push towards open science put forward at both European and national level. And we believe that the exchange of information is at the heart of science itself. \\nIn line with the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity code, we adhere to the principle, “As open as possible, as closed as necessary”. Within Vlerick, we take a pragmatic approach and implement policies around open access and data management sensibly – and in support of the open science movement. \\nHow we conduct research \\nIn 2019, Vlerick became an institutional partner of the Responsible Research in Business & Management (RRBM) network. As signatories of the RRBM vision paper, we endorse the principle that academic research should play a role in developing knowledge that benefits businesses and wider society – with the ultimate goal of creating a better world. \\nAs a partner, we support their seven principles: \\nService to society \\nValuing both basic and applied contributions \\nValuing plurality and multidisciplinary collaboration \\nSound methodology \\nStakeholder involvement \\nImpact on stakeholders \\nBroad dissemination \\nWe are one of the few business schools in the world to be recognised as a “RRBM Pioneering Institution”. This designation recognises our commitment to the principles and vision of RRBM – and that we are a source of best practice. It also highlights that we strive to have societal impact through our research and teaching programmes. \\nBeing relevant to both business and society means we involve stakeholders. This may appear to be an obvious thing to do – but in the academic world, this isn’t always so. We are always alert to gaps that exist in fields of knowledge highlighted by stakeholders – and we explore them with academic rigour. We know that the world needs research that makes impact – and we are committed to delivering it.',\n",

Our continuously-growing collection of print and online resources spans the whole spectrum of business and management topics. We offer a massive number of books and e-books, an extensive e-journal collection, a wide variety of databases and an extensive selection of national and international media.\\nAccessing the Vlerick Library\\nCurrent students, faculty, researchers and staff alike are welcome to browse our collection and make use of our library services – in person, or online. Graduates and visitors can dive into our wealth of wisdom as walk-in users, and make use of resources on the premises. There are separate arrangements for Vlerick alumni. \\nThe Vlerick Library is teaming-up with Lean Library (LL), offering an entirely new way of accessing content. By installing the LL browser extension, you can simply search the web and get notified by a pop-up message when content is available through the library.\\nFinding what you need\\nUse our search platform to find everything you need. You can run basic or advanced searches of all our books, e-books, journals, academic publications, reports, video and media. Simple searches are possible without logging in. \\nLearn how to work with our search platform through this LibGuide.\\nDatabases and news sources\\nDatabases\\nWe have a wide selection of databases containing company information, company financials, industries and financial markets. You can also access video and media databases to find news articles. \\nNews sources\\nKeep your finger on the pulse of what’s happening in business and society – and make use of our subscriptions to a wide variety of news sources and business magazines. These include the Financial Times and Harvard Business Review. \\nLibrary services\\nHow to borrow books from us\\nFirst, register free of charge at the library desk on our Ghent campus. \\nBorrow up to six books at a time and keep them for up to four weeks. Unless the books have been reserved in the meantime, you can extend the loan period twice. \\nMake book reservations by phone, email or via our online catalogue, where you can fill out a book request form. Then pick up your book in Ghent at the library desk – or have it delivered to our Brussels or Leuven campus reception desks. \\nTo return books, drop them into one of our book delivery boxes in Ghent, Leuven or Brussels. \\nIf a publication is not available in our collection, you can make an interlibrary loan request by filling out the form in our online catalogue – or by sending us an email. \\nPlease do make suggestions for the library – we want our collection to suit your needs. \\nTraining sessions\\nJoin one of our regular training sessions to find out how to use our databases and online news resources. Contact the library for dates and topics of upcoming sessions. \\nGuides and tutorials\\nBecome a library pro! Use our LibGuides and video tutorials to find out everything you need to know about using the library – including how to use databases, access collections and learn search tips and tricks. \\nLibrary loft\\nDigital resources are great. But if you’re looking for silence, head to the Library Loft. This cosy space is perfect for work, study and research – or even a relaxing read.

And if you need to have a quick conversation without disturbing the silence, just make your way up to the loft’s calm and comfortable office space, and close the door behind you.\\nCome on in...\\nLocation\\nFind us on the ground floor of our Ghent campus – which you can get to via our main campus entrance.

       "  'text': \"Taking stock\\nMario is a man with a mission: to convince as large an audience as possible of the importance and possibilities of data-driven project management – the quantitative tools and techniques to support projects. He has considerable experience under his belt: this is his sixth book on the subject. His previous publication, The Data-Driven Project Manager, focused on the practice of project management, and it was written in the form of a novel. The Illusion of Control takes a different tack. “Everyone has their own way of understanding things. That’s why each time I take a different approach to tackling the same subject.” This time, he approaches the role of data from an academic perspective. During a lecture at a conference for professionals, he had noticed that they were also genuinely interested in academic research.\\nAs it happened, that conference was almost exactly twenty years after he completed his doctorate. “And after twenty years, you do take stock of your career now and then,” Mario smiles. “I realised I’d come a long way with my academic colleagues, students and people in the field. They have helped to shape my career and research, and I wanted to thank them for that – not with a traditional acknowledgements page, but by interweaving the stories of our work together through the entire book.”\\nThree to remember if you want to get to grips with data\\nData is a means, not an end. The fact that data takes centre stage in this book does not make it the be all and end all. A blinkered focus on quantitative methods and techniques with no attention to experience and intuition may give a false sense of control, hence the book's title.\\nFirst the data, then the experience or intuition. After all, countless studies have shown that our experience and intuition are often distorted. Data helps detect our bias. A quantitative approach may confirm what you already suspected, or it may offer a new perspective. “Garbage in, garbage out is often used as an excuse not to do anything with data,” Mario says. “But various sensitivity experiments in the book show that the data doesn’t even need to be 100% correct all the time. The statistical techniques we use are often more robust and less sensitive to errors than human intuition.”\\nIt isn’t all or nothing. For anyone who wants to take steps towards data-driven project management, there is a wide range of methods and techniques. Some are a little more difficult than others, but you don’t need to start using them all at once. “It’s a question of exploring,” he stresses. “Simulations really aren’t state-of-the-art technology – you can get a long way in Excel. Start by taking baby steps. Try a technique. Does it confirm what you already knew? Great – because if it does, you can take another new step.”\\nFrom research to practice in five parts\\nThe Illusion of Control is in five parts. After a first, introductory part on the basic principles of data-driven project management, the data you need and the various methods you find in the literature, the next three parts form the lion’s share of the book. Part two describes how academics use project data to test new ideas and methods. It considers the existing techniques and increases understanding of why this data is usable for certain projects but not for others. Then it discusses the various new statistical techniques that may deliver considerably better results. Finally, it elucidates a few advanced techniques, such as machine learning. Mario reveals a glimpse of this part: “Machine learning surely has potential, but it is still too early for practical applications in project management.”\\nAcademic research must be practically relevant, Mario believes. In his leisure time, he paints – his paintings give shape to his creative imagination. He feels that he is an artist in his field of research as well. “That is where I give my academic imagination free rein, but ultimately it needs to culminate in something concrete.” Part three is illustrated with case studies, and it recounts what researchers do to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The fourth and most substantial part focuses on project data. “Where do we get project data from? How do we generate it? Where do we save it? What do we do with it – or, in other words, how do we analyse it?” In the fifth and final part, Mario sketches the four characteristics that he believes define the perfect researcher.\\nArtificial and empirical data\\nSo the emphasis is on data, but what data? “On the one hand, you have data that describes the characteristics of a project, such as the construction of a bridge, which means the activities, the relationships between those activities, the run time, cost estimates and so on,” Mario explains. “On the other hand, you have progress data, which is data about the work done on a project. Now, there are three ways to obtain this data. You can generate artificial project data. That seems simple, but it isn’t; you need to get it just right, so that you can do relevant research with it. So it's more complex than just throwing a few figures into a spreadsheet. You can also collect empirical data: data from real projects. Once again, that isn’t as easy as it seems. Everyone has project data, except the data that's really needed. Last but not least, you can derive artificial data from the empirical data using statistical techniques.\\nData calibration\\nThe trouble is that empirical data contains errors, falsehoods and biases: the project was delayed by three weeks, but the reports say it was on time. Project data is sometimes also interpreted incorrectly: say an activity took four days, but reporting is weekly, those four days may become five. So it is crucial to calibrate data in such a way that you obtain the truth, that you filter out the human errors, as it were, until what is left is the real data for academic research. In fact, the book devotes an entire chapter to data calibration.\\n“By using real data from past projects in research, we gain useful insights that help to predict budgets and run times better in practice, and to trace losses of control or deviations,” Mario explains. “You see,” he enthuses, “that is the ultimate goal of our research: to manage projects better thanks to better planning, better risk management and better monitoring during implementation, based on data and statistical methods.”\\nAccessible and original\\nThe Illusion of Control is the story of twenty years’ research and experience, brought together in an accessibly written book that is so comprehensive that both beginners and readers with experience will have something to gain from it. It is aimed at both theoreticians and practitioners. Researchers familiar with the academic literature will find context in this work: the bigger picture that is missing if you only read individual studies. Professionals in the field will gain a unique glimpse behind the scenes of scientific research, insight into the theoretical substantiation of practical tools and techniques, and a foretaste of what will be possible in the near or distant future as better data becomes available.\\nFurthermore, besides being an in-depth work about the academic background of data-driven project management and the unceasing search for practical relevance, The Illusion of Control is the story of Mario’s collaboration with people who have gone from being professional contacts to becoming friends. That is precisely what makes this book so original.\\nWant to read more?\\nThe Illusion of Control: Project Data, Computer Algorithms and Human Intuition for Project Management and Control is published by Springer and available from good bookshops. You can also order the book on Amazon.\",\n",

What do we do with it – or, in other words, how do we analyse it?” In the **fifth** and final part, Mario sketches the four characteristics that he believes define the **perfect researcher**.\\n\\n### Artificial and empirical data\\n\\nSo the emphasis is on data, but what data? “On the one hand, you have data that describes the characteristics of a project, such as the construction of a bridge, which means the activities, the relationships between those activities, the run time, cost estimates and so on,” Mario explains. “On the other hand, you have progress data, which is data about the work done on a project. Now, there are three ways to obtain this data. You can generate artificial project data. That seems simple, but it isn’t; you need to get it just right, so that you can do relevant research with it. So it's more complex than just throwing a few figures into a spreadsheet. You can also collect empirical data: data from real projects. Once again, that isn’t as easy as it seems. Everyone has project data, except the data that's really needed. Last but not least, you can derive artificial data from the empirical data using statistical techniques.\\n\\n### Data calibration\\n\\nThe trouble is that empirical data contains errors, falsehoods and biases: the project was delayed by three weeks, but the reports say it was on time. Project data is sometimes also interpreted incorrectly: say an activity took four days, but reporting is weekly, those four days may become five. So it is crucial to calibrate data in such a way that you obtain the truth, that you filter out the human errors, as it were, until what is left is the real data for academic research. In fact, the book devotes an entire chapter to data calibration.\\n\\n“By using real data from past projects in research, we gain useful insights that help to predict budgets and run times better in practice, and to trace losses of control or deviations,” Mario explains. “You see,” he enthuses, “that is the ultimate goal of our research: to manage projects better thanks to better planning, better risk management and better monitoring during implementation, based on data and statistical methods.”\\n\\n### **Accessible and original**\\n\\n_The Illusion of Control_ is the story of twenty years’ research and experience, brought together in an accessibly written book that is so comprehensive that both beginners and readers with experience will have something to gain from it. It is aimed at both theoreticians and practitioners. Researchers familiar with the academic literature will find context in this work: the bigger picture that is missing if you only read individual studies. Professionals in the field will gain a unique glimpse behind the scenes of scientific research, insight into the theoretical substantiation of practical tools and techniques, and a foretaste of what will be possible in the near or distant future as better data becomes available.\\n\\nFurthermore, besides being an in-depth work about the academic background of data-driven project management and the unceasing search for practical relevance, _The Illusion of Control_ is the story of Mario’s collaboration with people who have gone from being professional contacts to becoming friends. That is precisely what makes this book so original.\\n\\n**Want to read more?**\\n\\n_The Illusion of Control: Project Data, Computer Algorithms and Human Intuition for Project Management and Control_ is published by [Springer](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-31785-9) and available from good bookshops.

The only objective when scaling is to grow your business as fast as you can, whilst keeping all the balls in the air.\\nJurgen identifies three major challenges faced by Edgard & Cooper during their growth journey: scaling the people business, making sound financial decisions, and adapting sales and marketing tactics as the company expands. The conversation delves into the complexities of maintaining an entrepreneurial culture, managing talent, ensuring sustainable profitability, and navigating financial decisions, especially in the context of external factors like the pandemic and inflation.

       "  'text': \"These are just some of the findings from the annual study of CEO remuneration in Belgian and European listed companies, conducted by the Executive Remuneration Research Centre at Vlerick Business School. This study, based on 2022's remuneration reports, was conducted by Professor Xavier Baeten and Senior Researcher Marthe Van Hove. The specific focus of this year’s study, besides the level and composition of remuneration packages, was the underlying performance indicators and complexity of remuneration systems.\\nEvolution of top salaries in Belgium\\nThe study provides an annual overview of key remuneration data as well as its evolution. For example, the median total remuneration (including fixed salary, bonus and long-term remuneration) for Belgian listed companies in 2022 stood at €873,609, down from €919,559 the previous year. For the Bel 20 companies this stood at €2,701,216, with Bel Mid and Bel Small companies at €868,303 and €579,692, respectively. This puts Belgium well down in the international rankings. Within the Stoxx 600 index, which includes the largest companies in both the European Union and the United Kingdom, (median) CEO remuneration is €4,787,522 for Germany and €4,107,968 for the United Kingdom.\\nXavier Baeten, Professor of Reward & Sustainability at Vlerick Business School: “These median figures do not tell us the full story, as they only reflect the mean perception (i.e. of the company in the middle) when ranking the figures from high to low. Therefore, we carried out two more analyses. Firstly, we looked at how many CEOs experienced an increase or decrease in terms of their remuneration. Within the Bel 20, 42% experienced a decrease, with this figure at 34% and 50% for Bel Mid and Bel Small companies, respectively. This immediately tells us that remuneration is not constantly on the rise. We then also found a significant correlation with company profitability. Secondly, we accounted for the fact that we're talking about a wide range here. For Bel 20 companies, for example, the first quartile – where it was observed that a quarter of CEOs earned less – stood at €1,376,985, while the third quartile stood at €5,330,778. That means the total remuneration for half of CEOs among Bel 20 companies is within a range of roughly between €1.4 and €5.3 million.”\\nFinancial performance indicators remain dominant\\nThis year, the study paid particular attention to the performance measures used to determine short-term bonuses in listed Belgian companies. At the top of the list, we find financial indicators. More specifically, we are talking turnover figures (used by 52% of companies), cash flow (39%) and various profitability measures. Environmental indicators are on the up, but are still used less than, for example, employee engagement (17%) or customer engagement (12%). In reality, only 6% of companies incorporated any form of emissions-related performance measure, with the same applying to measures on energy usage and consumption of other resources.\\nXavier Baeten: “While it makes sense that the list should be dominated by financial indicators, it should also be noted that environmental indicators continue to lag behind – a somewhat painful observation to make in the run-up to the COP 28 United Nations climate conference. We also found that Belgian companies are reluctant to be more transparent when it comes to their chosen performance indicators. Many companies are continuing to employ deliberately vague terminology in their remuneration reports, often without setting concrete benchmarks.”\\nSignificant increase in the complexity of remuneration systems\\nThis year's study also sought to identify the degree of complexity of remuneration systems. To that end, the researchers drew on existing scientifically validated measures, and subjected these to rigorous field testing. To determine the level of complexity, factors taken into account included the number of instruments employed in determining remuneration levels, whether bonus payments were spread out over time, and some of the characteristics of the performance indicators used for variable remuneration.\\nMarthe Van Hove, Senior Researcher at Vlerick Business School: “We note that CEO remuneration has significantly increased in complexity over the years, albeit with a slight decrease during the pandemic. Moreover, we find that the degree of complexity is higher in companies who pay their CEOs more than average, and where a higher proportion of remuneration is awarded in the form of variable remuneration. We also observe higher complexity in companies where board members have served on the board for a shorter period of time and there are a higher number of directors. However, the most striking finding is the negative correlation between complexity and company performance. This means that, the more complex the remuneration system, the more negative the impact on company performance in the long run. As such, companies have every incentive to keep their remuneration systems simple.”\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Four types of leadership\\n“If the digital transformation is to succeed,” begins Stijn, “it must have the support of everyone in the organisation. Digital transformation is rather like turning a tanker; it's not something that can be achieved by a mere handful of people, let alone one individual. Our model therefore regards leadership as the connection and mobilisation of people and ideas in order to detect opportunities and make the most of them.”\\nThe Digital Leadership Model, or 4V model, distinguishes between four types of leadership:\\nVigilant: leaders who take on this role are trying to navigate their way through turbulent times of digital disruption. They are constantly scanning the environment, including far beyond the boundaries of their organisation or sector, looking for ideas and opportunities.\\nVoyager: this type of leadership succeeds in tapping into the creativity of individuals and teams, turning abstract opportunities into concrete solutions through experimentation. \\nVisionary: leaders who take on this role paint a convincing and ambitious picture of a successful digital company. They make sure that everyone in the organisation feels as if they are striving towards a common goal.\\nVested: this type of leadership actually puts the entire organisation, like a well-oiled machine, on the path to successful digital transformation.\\nLeadership is a team effort\\nStijn emphasises that this isn't about leadership styles. “Our model defines a specific type of leadership as a set of behaviours. It’s what you do that determines the type of leadership you demonstrate and the leadership role you adopt. As a result, it has nothing to do with personality styles or with introvert or extrovert leaders.”\\nHe follows: “Each type can't be traced back to a single individual either, but stems from close collaboration between a group of people who are spread across the organisation. Of course you can be good at more than one role, but I've never met anyone who could combine all four.”\\nNothing beats experience\\nThe model is accompanied by a game. Why? “We are constantly looking for new and more effective ways to teach theoretical concepts and models,” answers Stijn. “We now know that gamification leads to the faster and better absorption of knowledge. So while you can explain these kinds of models, which we do, during the game the participants actually get to experience what we mean in practice.”\\nThree rounds\\nThe game revolves around the digital transformation of a fictitious bank and consists of three rounds. The participants are divided into small groups, each with their own assignment or project – developing a specific app, setting up the bank branch of the future, outlining the IT strategy etc. At the end of the journey, all these projects must naturally fit together.\\n“In the first round, we throw the participants in at the deep end,” says Stijn. “Under time pressure, they have to make all kinds of decisions while being faced with unexpected events on a regular basis. They soon realise that coordinating these initiatives is no easy task. The second round is a moment of reflection. We touch on a sore point: if you aren't tackling the transformation in an integrated way, end-to-end, then you're not actually transforming at all. We show how the various roles in the model can solve the problems which they encountered during the first round. Finally, during the third round they experience how it feels to assimilate these four roles and collaborate, instead of rushing forward blindly and tackling problems on their own, predictable though it may seem.”\\nFor anyone who feels the calling\\nThe half-day course really gets to the essence of a successful digital transformation. A huge achievement, and Stijn is rightly proud of this new formula.\\nSo who is this course intended for exactly? “The model reveals the answer,” he says. “For anyone who wants to play a pioneering role, in any department and at any level in the organisation – it's for managers and non-managers alike. After all, leadership is behaviour and in this model it is separated from your position or hierarchical responsibilities. It's about what you do, not what's on your card.”\\nReady to put things into practice\\nWill the participants actually be able to put things into practice after this half-day course? “Definitely,” confirms Stijn. “Not only will they understand the model, they will also be able translate it into the context of their own organisation. In addition, they will be able to profile themselves and their colleagues as one or more of the four types. And, not unimportantly, they will be able to enter into ‘coalitions’. As we already mentioned, these four leadership roles will ideally comprise different people (spread across the company) who collaborate, learning while doing and sharing best practices. So yes, even after half a day they will be ready to put the model into practice.”\\nNot a blank slate\\n“The good thing about our model is that you can apply it without turning your whole organisation upside down – precisely because we have freed leadership from its traditional place in the organisation,” concludes Stijn. “We apply an extra ‘layer’ on top of the existing structures, as it were. And as long as you put enough weight on it, this extra layer can break through the silos.”\\nHow did our participants experience the Digital Transformation Leaders Game?\\nOliver Regidor, Digital Transformation Programme Manager at Argenta:\\n“What I loved? The fact that we were confronted with new information and challenges over and over, making the game quite unpredictable yet so realistic. It also kept us focused. What I found particularly innovative and inspiring was the focus on leadership types – when people talk about digital transformation, they usually talk about technology or agile approaches. After the game, we immediately decided to put the theory into practice! We recently swapped the program-project structure of our digital transformation initiative for a start-up organisation, with small, independent teams that do not necessarily follow the sometimes cumbersome, traditional Argenta procedures. The teams are directed by a leadership team that establishes the vision, strategy and approach to be followed. In the first phase, each of the four team members will take on a different leadership role. In the future, one person may even be able to combine several roles, but for now, we want to gain some experience.”\\nElisabeth Østreng, consulting engineer at Statnett, the Norwegian TSO:\\n“One of the good things about the game was that this fictional company operated in an industry completely different from the one I work in. This made it easier to think outside the box as you don’t feel constrained by what you know. Mind you, at times it was quite challenging and, dare I say, chaotic, because the context changed faster than it would in real life. Then again, in reality you often don’t get much time to asses a situation and take decisions either. So, the game was like reality on speed. Besides, the different leadership roles were also quite recognisable, we all knew colleagues that fit into one of the four types. But the real eye-opener was that, for digital transformation to succeed, we should connect and collaborate more. We should reach out to our customers and other stakeholders in our ecosystem. But not only that: we all tend to work in the silos of our own departments, especially in large companies. We also need to find ways to better connect with our colleagues!”\\nBram Mommers, Global Director Digital Asset Lifecycle at Arcadis:\\n“It was a painful reality check. Various groups were formed and each group was assigned a task. We quickly realised that working together was a must, yet we all remained on our own little island. When we did eventually join forces, we all continued to focus on our personal perspectives and interests. As you can imagine, it was not long before we were all ignoring what everyone else said. Not to mention the wasted effort – people were fretting about things that were entirely beside the point. In a nutshell, you could tell it was really difficult. You could see us struggling to find a common language. That really struck a chord with me. Day in, day out, we try to get everyone on the same wavelength and filter away the irrelevancies and misunderstandings, because they are incredibly counterproductive. To me, that is the greatest added value of the game - it highlights the struggle. I don’t know whether people realise that is the way it is for many organisations.”\\nSo, if the game failed to give him new insights, what made it so valuable? “Identifying with the topic helps you pinpoint and label what you feel. When you’re struggling with something and you meet people facing the same issues, you suddenly realise you’re not alone. That allows you to find meaning in your problems and address them with more confidence. That is exactly how the game works.”\",\n",

Participants have the flexibility to take an accelerated track, and finish in less time, or to extend their study beyond the standard timeframe. \\nLearning stage\\nThe objective of the first stage is to develop your research capabilities. You’ll take part in five week-long, courses that cover the entire research cycle. In these intensive sessions, you’ll develop the knowledge and skills you need to complete your doctoral journey. You’ll be supported by our online learning platform, where you can discuss content and ideas with colleagues and submit your assignments. \\nYou attend all five courses – and dedicate time to preparing beforehand, studying afterwards and completing assignments, papers and exams. At the end of the learning stage, a formal progress assessment is conducted to admit you to the research stage . \\nResearch stage \\nIn the second stage of the programme, you work on three doctoral assignments and put your research proposal into practice and develop your thesis. You’ll collect and analyse data, draft your results – and, with the help of your supervisors, present your work to different audiences. You’ll also need to present your research to your supervisory committee in three doctoral seminars. A unique feature of our programme is that a significant number of the requirements are part of an elective system. You can tailor the programme to your needs and ambitions.\\nAt the end of this stage, you’ll take part in a PhD defence at either Ghent University or KU Leuven. You can present your thesis in different ways. It can either be made up of different papers, or be presented in book format with content for three high-level papers. \\nDevelop the skills and knowledge to carry out innovative, ground-breaking and impactful research\\nGain academic expertise in a topic relevant to your organisation\\nJoin a community of international academics and professionals from industries all over the world – with plenty of opportunities to build connections and further your research\\nPut together your own tailored package of research, business and teaching electives to meet your needs and ambitions\\nEarn a Certificate of Management Research from Vlerick and a Joint PhD degree from Ghent University and KU Leuven \\nThe DBA is for experienced professionals who want to:\\nDeepen their business understanding from a theoretical perspective\\nEngage in academically robust, practice-based research\\nCreate new knowledge – and make an even greater impact on their organisation, sector or even society\\nBecome part of a diverse community of academics and professionals from over the world\\nObtain a PhD degree from two top institutions \\nUpcoming DBA info sessions\\nInfo session\\n23Jan\\nOnline Info Session: Doctorate in Business Administration\\n6.00-7.00 pm\\nOnline\\nThe tuition fee for the DBA is €66,000: \\nFirst year: €6,000 non-refundable commitment fee + €18,000 \\nSecond year: €12,000\\nThird to fifth year: €10,000 per year\\nThe DBA is designed to be flexible and fit around your schedule – so if needed, you can have more time to complete your qualification. The fee for each extra year is €6,500. \\nYour fees include: \\nTuition to and guidance at the three institutions for five years\\nAll course materials \\nA voucher towards your personal growth package – so you can attend conferences at Vlerick and other institutions \\nAccess to business and research databases and specialised collections \\nUse of campus facilities \\nVlerick Alumni network membership \\nOnline subscription for the Financial Times \\nFood and drinks during on-campus course weeks and activities \\nThe fees do not include travel or accommodation. \\nTo join the DBA programme, you need: \\nA Flemish Master’s degree or equivalent (inter)national higher education degree\\nTo have graduated with distinction \\nAt least 10 years’ managerial experience – with some experience at executive level \\nYou also need to: \\nSubmit an initial research topic that relates to our expertise and is academically challenging \\nExplain your motivation for joining the programme \\nSubmit a GMAT/GRE test score gained no more than five years ago (unless you’re eligible for an exemption) – or show you’ve achieved a second distinction during your studies \\nProve you’re fluent in English \\nStart your journey \\nWe accept admissions on a rolling basis – and discuss applications during our monthly DBA team meetings. \\nThe DBA is a significant commitment – which is why you go through two stages before you begin the full programme. This gives you the opportunity to experience academic research before committing to the full programme. \\n1. Eligibility stage \\nFirst we assess if you meet the admissions requirements – and learn more about your ambitions. \\nHere’s what you need to do: \\nFill in the eligibility form online, and upload your: \\nCV \\nDiplomas and transcripts \\nGMAT/GRE report (if applicable) \\nEnglish Language Proficiency Exam score (if applicable) \\nWrite a short essay with your motivation and – if you know already – your research question. \\nHowever, we now also offer an alternative approach, where candidates can choose a research topic proposed by a faculty member. Discover the available faculty-proposed projects here.\\nIf you meet the criteria – and we think the programme is a good fit for you – we’ll set up an in-depth interview with your academic director and some content experts. They’ll talk to you, suggest relevant academic papers for you to read – and help you to refine your research topic. Based upon these conversations, you submit your research idea with reference to two academic papers.\\nThe DBA team will then discuss your file – and if you’re eligible, you’ll be accepted onto the programme. \\n2. Commitment stage \\nOnce you’ve been accepted and paid your commitment fee, you can access our online resources immediately and start working on your initial research topic with our content experts. \\nAfter the first course in September, you’ll write a paper on your research idea – and get feedback from the course holder. At this point, we’ll ask you to confirm your commitment to the four-year programme – and to pay the remaining fee for the first year. \\nSuccess stories\\nSofie De Beule-Roloff\\nCOO and management team member At European Stability Mechanism (ESM)\\nI want to give something back to society and transfer my passion and knowledge to the next generations. For me, it's about giving, taking, giving back, and so on. A DBA is not a ‘free lunch’. The programme will cost me blood, sweat and possibly tears. But if it lets me give something back to society, no matter how small, I’ll be motivated to keep toiling and sweating.\\nBarbara Arnst\\nHead of Agile Centre of Excellence, Telenet\\nAcademic research is all about focusing on a particular element of a puzzle. It's an entirely new approach to anyone who comes in from the business world, because we tend to cultivate a broad view in business. Personal motivation aside, I want this project to have some real significance. In my current job, of course. But I’m thinking further ahead too. I think I can be of inspiration to other businesses in a consultancy role.\\nBenjamin De Brabander\\nPartner, KMPG Belgium\\nWhat do I hope to achieve with my research? To begin with, I see it as an enrichment for my team. When young people come aboard, it’s an added benefit to train them through the lens of your practical know-how – and by adding your academic experience you bring them to a higher level. I also see it as personal development. And thirdly, a PhD opens doors. It gives you a way into teaching, which I certainly see myself doing in the future.\\nLuc Wynant \\nPartner at Van Olmen & Wynant \\nI have been a lawyer in a corporate environment for almost 30 years, working with private equity and venture capital. Over time, I’ve started to see interesting patterns emerge in management buyout situations. The DBA has allowed me to trace these patterns – and also apply and generalise them.\",\n",

They’ll talk to you, suggest relevant academic papers for you to read\\xa0–\\xa0and help you to\\xa0refine\\xa0your research topic.\\xa0Based upon these conversations, you submit your research idea with reference to two academic papers.\\n\\nThe DBA team will then discuss your file – and if you’re eligible,\\xa0you’ll be accepted onto the programme.\\xa0\\n\\n#### **2\\\\. Commitment stage**\\xa0\\n\\nOnce you’ve\\xa0been accepted and\\xa0paid your commitment fee, you can access our online resources immediately\\xa0and start working on your initial research topic with our content experts.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nAfter the first course in September, you’ll write\\xa0a\\xa0paper on your research idea – and get feedback from the course holder. At this point, we’ll ask you to confirm your commitment to the four-year programme – and to pay the remaining fee for the first year.\\xa0\\n\\n## Success stories\\n\\n![Sofie De Beule - Roloff](https://www.vlerick.com/static/b30e52181d16492c3ed5aaa7fb3e9916/ece15/web_gatsby_migration-Sofie-De-Beule-Roloff.jpg)\\n\\n### Sofie De Beule-Roloff\\n\\nCOO and management team member At European Stability Mechanism (ESM)\\n\\nI want to\\xa0give something back to society and transfer my passion and knowledge to the next generations. For me, it's about giving, taking, giving back, and so on. A DBA is not a ‘free lunch’. The programme will cost me blood, sweat and possibly tears. But if it lets me give something back to society, no matter how small, I’ll be motivated to keep toiling and sweating.\\n\\n![Testimonal icon aquablue](https://dam.vlerick.com/m/da213274f50ff58/web_gatsby_migration-Testimonal-icon-aquablue.svg)\\n\\n### Barbara Arnst\\n\\nHead of Agile Centre of Excellence, Telenet\\n\\nAcademic research is all about focusing on a particular element of a puzzle. It's an entirely new approach to anyone who comes in from the business world, because we tend to cultivate a broad view in business. Personal motivation aside, I want this project to have some real significance. In my current job, of course. But I’m thinking further ahead too. I think I can be of inspiration to other businesses in a consultancy role.\\n\\n![Benjamin De Brabander (002)](https://www.vlerick.com/static/c12fa71f033f5a6b723196247f0b4133/bbf44/web_gatsby_migration-Benjamin-De-Brabander-002.jpg)\\n\\n### Benjamin De Brabander\\n\\nPartner, KMPG Belgium\\n\\nWhat do I hope to achieve with my research? To begin with, I see it as an enrichment for my team. When young people come aboard, it’s an added benefit to train them through the lens of your practical know-how – and by adding your academic experience you bring them to a higher level. I also see it as personal development. And thirdly, a PhD opens doors. It gives you a way into teaching, which I certainly see myself doing in the future.\\n\\n![Luc Wynant](https://www.vlerick.com/static/025c03bd9b570e41a340907251b05d3b/5cd33/webimage-AC480340-6126-4346-806AE50ADF370CF1.png)\\n\\n### Luc Wynant\\n\\nPartner at Van Olmen & Wynant\\n\\nI have been a lawyer in a corporate environment for almost\\xa030\\xa0years,\\xa0working with private equity and venture capital.

We take steps to ensure that the information we collect is processed according to this privacy policy and the requirements of applicable law wherever the data is located.\\nWhen we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area to other countries in which applicable laws do not offer the same level of data privacy protection as in Belgium, we take measures to provide an appropriate level of data privacy protection. In other words, your rights and protections remain with your data.\\nSecuring your personal data\\nVlerick Business School guarantees that the processing of your personal data takes place in an adequate, correct and safe manner. If you wish, you will be informed in a transparent manner about the processing procedures and the appropriate technical and organizational security measures taken to protect the personal data we are processing against accidental loss or damage and unauthorised access, use, disclosure, alteration or destruction and to ensure the confidentiality, security, integrity and availability of personal data.\\nHow long we will keep your data\\nWe will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.\\nThe length of time we retain your personal data is determined by a number of factors including the purpose for which we use that information and our obligations under other laws. We determine the period of retention of your personal data based on the following criteria:\\nRetention in case of queries. We will retain your personal data in case of queries from you, including on behalf of an organisation for whom you work.\\nRetention in case of claims. We will retain certain of your personal data for the period in which you or a third party might bring claims against us. \\nRetention in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements.

Aside from the situations that have been specifically mentioned above, Vlerick Business School will not disclose personal data to third parties, unless required to do so by law.\\n\\nWhen we share your personal data with third parties that are controllers of that information, they may disclose or transfer it to other organisations in accordance with their data protection policies.

We take steps to ensure that the information we collect is processed according to this privacy policy and the requirements of applicable law wherever the data is located.\\n\\nWhen we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area to other countries in which applicable laws do not offer the same level of data privacy protection as in Belgium, we take measures to provide an appropriate level of data privacy protection. In other words, your rights and protections remain with your data.\\n\\n## Securing your personal data\\n\\nVlerick Business School guarantees that the processing of your personal data takes place in an adequate, correct and safe manner. If you wish, you will be informed in a transparent manner about the processing procedures and the appropriate technical and organizational security measures taken to protect the personal data we are processing against accidental loss or damage and unauthorised access, use, disclosure, alteration or destruction and to ensure the confidentiality, security, integrity and availability of personal data.\\n\\n## How long we will keep your data\\n\\nWe will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.\\n\\nThe length of time we retain your personal data is determined by a number of factors including the purpose for which we use that information and our obligations under other laws.

We will retain your personal data in case of queries from you, including on behalf of an organisation for whom you work.\\n*   Retention in case of claims. We will retain certain of your personal data for the period in which you or a third party might bring claims against us.\\xa0\\n*   Retention in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements. We will carefully consider whether we need to retain your personal data after the period described above in case of a legal or regulatory requirement.\\n\\nThe exceptions to the above are where:\\n\\n*   you exercise your right to require us to retain your personal data for a period longer than our stated retention period (see further Restriction of processing below);\\xa0\\n*   you exercise your right to have the information erased (where it applies) and we do not need to hold it in connection with any of the reasons permitted or required under the law (see further Request deletion below);\\xa0\\n*   we bring or defend a legal claim or other proceedings during the period we retain your personal data, in which case we will retain your personal data until those proceedings have concluded and no further appeals are possible; or\\xa0\\n*   in limited cases, existing or future law or a court or regulator requires us to keep your personal data for a longer or shorter period.\\n\\nWhen we no longer need your personal data, we securely delete or destroy it.\\n\\n## Your rights regarding your personal data\\n\\nThe European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and other applicable data protection laws provide you with rights over your personal data.\\n\\nVlerick Business School respects your right to access and control your information, and we will respond to requests for information and, where applicable, will correct, amend, or delete your personal data.

Vlerick shall make commercially reasonable efforts to inform the Contracting Party of any significant changes to the Programme in a timely manner.\\n3.3. The Contracting Party acknowledges and agrees that, while Vlerick aims to deliver the Programme or Product as described on the website or in promotional materials, certain circumstances may require adaptations or substitutions of Programme elements.\\n3.4.

Fees and payment\\n4.3.1. The Contracting Party shall pay the fees for the Programme as specified by Vlerick on the Website or in the customized offer. All fees are stated and shall be paid in Euro. Vlerick specifies whether taxes are applicable and if the indicated fees include or exclude taxes.\\n4.3.2. All Vlerick’s invoices are payable by the due date stated on the invoice, unless otherwise agreed or upon registration if they are to be paid immediately (e.g., online payment).\\nIf outstanding amount is not paid by the due date, the following rules apply:\\nFor Companies: legal interests will be charged automatically without notice of default. In addition, the Contracting Party shall also pay a fixed administrative fee covering the costs caused by the late payment. The Contracting Party acknowledges and agrees that this fee amounts to 10% of the total outstanding amount (exclusive of the interest) with a minimum fee of 65 EUR. Any other collecting charges are not included in the fixed fee and will be charged separately.\\nFor Consumers: any interests or costs will only be charged 14 days after the first reminder / notice of default. After this additional 14-day period, legal interest and the following additional fees will be charged: \\nFor amounts due < 150 EUR: 20 EUR\\nFor amounts due between 150.01 EUR and 500 EUR: 30 EUR + 10% of the amount due\\nFor amounts due > 500 EUR: 65 EUR + 5% of the amount due (and max. 5,000 EUR).\\nAny dispute over an invoice must be submitted in writing (by registered mail or e-mail with acknowledgement) to the secretariat of the Programme in question or, if not applicable, to Vlerick’s accounting department within 15 days after the receipt of the invoice. The submission of a complaint in no way leads to a suspension of payments.\\n4.3.3. If the Contracting Party fails to pay by the due date of the invoice and a price increase occurs after the due date of the invoice, Vlerick reserves the right to charge the price increase to this Contracting Party.\\n4.3.4.

Failing that, Vlerick reserves the right to cancel the registration and claim a cancellation fee pursuant to Article 4.4 below. \\n4.3.5. Apparent errors in the price offer can be corrected by Vlerick after the contract has been concluded.\\n4.3.6. When applicable, if the Contracting Party has opted to pay by credit card, then the conditions of the corresponding credit card issuer are applicable to such payments.

If the Contracting Party wishes to cancel their enrolment in the Programme, they must notify Vlerick in writing (letter or e-mail). To the secretariat of the Programme or, if not possible, to info@vlerick.com. Cancellation is only deemed valid after Vlerick has duly notified the Contracting Party and stated its acceptance of the cancellation.\\n4.4.2. In the case of ‘no show’(= non-attendance to the Programme without withdrawal as described below) all fees are fully due.\\n4.4.3. Vlerick reserves the right to cancel or reschedule a Programme due to unforeseen circumstances, including insufficient enrolment or speaker’s unavailability until 7 days before the start of the Programme. In the event of a cancellation by Vlerick, the Contracting Party will be offered the choice of a full refund of any fees paid or enrolment in a future Programme of equivalent value.\\n4.4.4. Vlerick offers the Contracting Party the opportunity to arrange for an acceptable replacement of a person, insofar as this person meets the criteria (if any) for participation in the Programme and only if the Programme has not started yet. No cancellation fee is then due. Non-attendance or early departure during the Programme will not be compensated.\\n4.4.5. Exceptionally, Vlerick may allow the Contracting Party, who cannot participate in the Programme, to participate in the next edition of this Programme, i.e., provided an edition with the same content will be organised and subject to the payment of a fixed administrative fee of 250 EUR (excl. 21% VAT). A rescheduling is only possible if all amounts due are paid before the start date of the Programme for which the Contracting Party was initially registered. Failing that, Vlerick reserves the right to cancel the registration and claim a cancellation fee pursuant to Art 4.4.8 to 4.4.10. If the Contracting Party nevertheless cancels after the rescheduling of the Programme, the full registration fee remains due and thus no refund is possible.\\n4.4.6. For memberships (e.g., Vlerick Alumni), no cancellation is possible and all paid fees are non-refundable.\\n4.4.7. Depending on whether the Contracting Party is a consumer or a company and unless agreed otherwise, the Contracting Party can cancel a Programme under the following conditions:\\nb) For consumers\\n4.4.8. For contracts concluded ‘at distance’ (e.g., via the Website), consumers have, pursuant to Art. VI.67 of the Belgian Code of Economics (‘WER’), 14 days to withdraw from the contract without giving a reason and without having to bear any costs other than those provided for in Art. VI.50, § 2 WER, and VI.51 WER. This can be done via an unambiguous written statement or via the following form.\\nHowever, if the withdrawal occurs only after the start of the Programme and if the Contracting Party has requested Vlerick to begin the performance of the services during the withdrawal period of 14 days, the Contracting Party will owe Vlerick a reasonable compensation. This reasonable compensation will be determined by Vlerick and takes into account what Vlerick has already provided when the consumer communicates the withdrawal to Vlerick, in comparison with the full coverage of the contract and taking into account the concrete circumstances (e.g. costs incurred, loss of profit, etc.).\\nThe consumer will no longer be entitled to withdraw from a contract:\\nAfter the consumer has been granted access to the digital content (or the digital content has been released) or\\nAfter a fee-based Programme has been fully completed.\\nIf the Programme has no fixed starting date and can therefore be accessed on a rolling basis (e.g. online Programmes) the Contracting Party may cancel their participation free of charge within a term of 14 days after receipt of the written confirmation of the registration, unless the Contracting Party has received access to the platform or the (first part of the) content bites. In the latter case, the full registration fee will be due.\\n4.4.9. Once the withdrawal period of 14 days provided in Art. 4.4.8 has expired, the standard general terms and conditions on cancellations (i.e. those applicable for companies, cf. infra under c)) are applicable.\\nc) For companies\\n4.4.10. If the Contracting Party is a company in the meaning of the Belgian Code of Economics and unless specified otherwise:\\nFor cancellations more than 90 days before the start of the Programme, no fee is due.\\nFor cancellations between 90 and 30 days before the start of the Programme, a fee amounting to 25% of the registration will be charged.\\nFor cancellations between 29 and 14 days before the start of the Programme, a fee amounting to 50% of the registration will be charged.\\nFor cancellations less than 14 days before the start of the Programme, the full registration fee is due.\\n4.4.11. If the Programme has no fixed starting date and can therefore be accessed on a rolling basis (e.g. online Programmes), the full registration fee will be due in the case of cancellation.\\n5.

The Contracting Party is obliged to closely examine the properties and details of the Products immediately after receipt. The Contracting Party must report their written complaint to Vlerick within 7 days of receipt. \\n6.2.3. For contracts concluded ‘at distance’ (e.g. via the Website), consumers have, pursuant to Art. VI.67 of the Belgian Code of Economics (‘WER’), 14 days to withdraw from the contract without giving a reason and without having to bear any costs other than those provided for in Articles VI.50, § 2 WER and VI.51 WER. This can be done via an unambiguous written statement or via the following form.\\n6.2.4. This withdrawal period will expire 14 days as of the day on which the consumer acquires physical possession of (the last item of the series of) the Products. Upon legitimate use of the right of withdrawal, Vlerick shall reimburse all payments received, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from the consumer’s choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by Vlerick), without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days as from the day on which Vlerick is informed about the decision to withdraw from the contract. Vlerick will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as the consumer used for the initial transaction, unless the consumer expressly agrees otherwise. The consumer shall send back the goods or hand them over to Vlerick without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days as from the day on which the withdrawal is communicated to Vlerick. The consumer will have to bear the direct costs of returning the goods. The consumer shall be liable for any diminished value of the goods resulting from handling, with the exception of handling that is necessary to establish the nature, characteristics and functioning of the goods.\\n6.2.5. This right to withdraw does not apply to companies in the meaning of the Belgian Code of Economics.\\n7. FORCE MAJEUR\\n7.1. Neither party shall be liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under their agreement, if such failure or delay is caused by circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to: strikes, labour unrest, actions or inactions by public authorities, serious transport disruptions including breakdowns, driving bans or fuel shortages, natural disasters, health epidemics, quarantines, civil unrest, acts of terrorism or other acts of violence or war (a ‘Force Majeure Event’).\\n7.2.

The parties shall negotiate in good faith to determine appropriate adjustments to the terms and conditions of the agreement to accommodate the impact of the Force Majeure Event. If the Force Majeure Event continues for a period exceeding 30 days, either party may terminate the agreement upon written notice to the other party, without any liability or obligation, except for payment of amounts due and owing up to the date of termination.\\n7.4. The party claiming Force Majeure shall bear the burden of proving that the Force Majeure Event was the sole cause of the failure or delay in performance.\\n8. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS\\n8.1.

PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA\\n10.1. The personal data provided by the Contracting Party is necessary for processing and completing contact forms, registrations, applications and contracts, as well as registrations on MyVlerick and the preparation of invoices.

By registering for a Program, the Contracting Party acknowledges that Vlerick will share the following personal data with (i) guest speakers, (ii) jury members, experts, and/or coaches, and (iii) fellow participants via e-mail, a participant list, and/or an online program app, based on Vlerick's legitimate interests:\\n(i) Guest speakers will receive the Contracting Party’s name, function and employer for the purpose of facilitating and preparing the guest speaker’s teaching sessions;\\n(ii) Jury members, experts and/or coaches will receive the Contracting Party’s name, company and e-mail for evaluating and coaching purposes;\\n(iii) Fellow participants will receive the contracting party’s name, function, employer and e-mail (and in the case of a long-term programme also the Contracting Party’s phone number) for the purpose of networking and group work.\\nThis data sharing is conducted on the basis of Vlerick's legitimate interest in ensuring the effectiveness and quality of the Programme.

In addition, the Contracting Party shall also pay a fixed administrative fee covering the costs caused by the late payment. The Contracting Party acknowledges and agrees that this fee amounts to 10% of the total outstanding amount (exclusive of the interest) with a minimum fee of 65 EUR. Any other collecting charges are not included in the fixed fee and will be charged separately.\\n*   For Consumers: any interests or costs will only be charged 14 days after the first reminder / notice of default. After this additional 14-day period, legal interest and the following additional fees will be charged:\\n    *   For amounts due < 150 EUR: 20 EUR\\n    *   For amounts due between 150.01 EUR and 500 EUR: 30 EUR + 10% of the amount due\\n    *   For amounts due > 500 EUR: 65 EUR + 5% of the amount due (and max. 5,000 EUR).\\n\\nAny dispute over an invoice must be submitted in writing (by registered mail or e-mail with acknowledgement) to the secretariat of the Programme in question or, if not applicable, to Vlerick’s accounting department within 15 days after the receipt of the invoice.

Cancellation and refunds**\\n\\n**a) General**\\n\\n**4.4.1.** If the Contracting Party wishes to cancel their enrolment in the Programme, they must notify Vlerick in writing (letter or e-mail). To the secretariat of the Programme or, if not possible, to [info@vlerick.com](mailto:info@vlerick.com). Cancellation is only deemed valid after Vlerick has duly notified the Contracting Party and stated its acceptance of the cancellation.\\n\\n**4.4.2.** In the case of ‘no show’(= non-attendance to the Programme without withdrawal as described below) all fees are fully due.\\n\\n**4.4.3.** Vlerick reserves the right to cancel or reschedule a Programme due to unforeseen circumstances, including insufficient enrolment or speaker’s unavailability until 7 days before the start of the Programme. In the event of a cancellation by Vlerick, the Contracting Party will be offered the choice of a full refund of any fees paid or enrolment in a future Programme of equivalent value.\\n\\n**4.4.4.** Vlerick offers the Contracting Party the opportunity to arrange for an acceptable replacement of a person, insofar as this person meets the criteria (if any) for participation in the Programme and only if the Programme has not started yet. No cancellation fee is then due. Non-attendance or early departure during the Programme will not be compensated.\\n\\n**4.4.5.** Exceptionally, Vlerick may allow the Contracting Party, who cannot participate in the Programme, to participate in the next edition of this Programme, i.e., provided an edition with the same content will be organised and subject to the payment of a fixed administrative fee of 250 EUR (excl. 21% VAT). A rescheduling is only possible if all amounts due are paid before the start date of the Programme for which the Contracting Party was initially registered. Failing that, Vlerick reserves the right to cancel the registration and claim a cancellation fee pursuant to Art 4.4.8 to 4.4.10. If the Contracting Party nevertheless cancels after the rescheduling of the Programme, the full registration fee remains due and thus no refund is possible.\\n\\n**4.4.6.** For memberships (e.g., Vlerick Alumni), no cancellation is possible and all paid fees are non-refundable.\\n\\n**4.4.7.** Depending on whether the Contracting Party is a consumer or a company and unless agreed otherwise, the Contracting Party can cancel a Programme under the following conditions:\\n\\n**b) For consumers**\\n\\n**4.4.8.** For contracts concluded ‘at distance’ (e.g., via the Website), **consumers** have, pursuant to Art.

This reasonable compensation will be determined by Vlerick and takes into account what Vlerick has already provided when the consumer communicates the withdrawal to Vlerick, in comparison with the full coverage of the contract and taking into account the concrete circumstances (e.g. costs incurred, loss of profit, etc.).\\n\\n_The consumer will no longer be entitled to withdraw from a contract_:\\n\\n*   After the consumer has been granted access to the digital content (or the digital content has been released) or\\n*   After a fee-based Programme has been fully completed.\\n\\nIf the Programme has no fixed starting date and can therefore be accessed on a rolling basis (e.g. online Programmes) the Contracting Party may cancel their participation free of charge within a term of 14 days after receipt of the written confirmation of the registration, unless the Contracting Party has received access to the platform or the (first part of the) content bites. In the latter case, the full registration fee will be due.\\n\\n**4.4.9.** Once the withdrawal period of 14 days provided in Art. 4.4.8 has expired, the standard general terms and conditions on cancellations (i.e. those applicable for companies, cf. infra under c)) are applicable.\\n\\n**c) For companies**\\n\\n**4.4.10.** If the Contracting Party is a company in the meaning of the Belgian Code of Economics and unless specified otherwise:\\n\\n*   For cancellations more than 90 days before the start of the Programme, no fee is due.\\n*   For cancellations between 90 and 30 days before the start of the Programme, a fee amounting to 25% of the registration will be charged.\\n*   For cancellations between 29 and 14 days before the start of the Programme, a fee amounting to 50% of the registration will be charged.\\n*   For cancellations less than 14 days before the start of the Programme, the full registration fee is due.\\n\\n**4.4.11.** If the Programme has _no fixed starting_ date and can therefore be accessed on a rolling basis (e.g. online Programmes), the full registration fee will be due in the case of cancellation.\\n\\n### 5\\\\.

Upon legitimate use of the right of withdrawal, Vlerick shall reimburse all payments received, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from the consumer’s choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by Vlerick), without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days as from the day on which Vlerick is informed about the decision to withdraw from the contract. Vlerick will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as the consumer used for the initial transaction, unless the consumer expressly agrees otherwise. The consumer shall send back the goods or hand them over to Vlerick without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days as from the day on which the withdrawal is communicated to Vlerick. The consumer will have to bear the direct costs of returning the goods.

FORCE MAJEUR\\n\\n**7.1.** Neither party shall be liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under their agreement, if such failure or delay is caused by circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to: strikes, labour unrest, actions or inactions by public authorities, serious transport disruptions including breakdowns, driving bans or fuel shortages, natural disasters, health epidemics, quarantines, civil unrest, acts of terrorism or other acts of violence or war (a ‘Force Majeure Event’).\\n\\n**7.2.** The party affected by the Force Majeure Event shall promptly notify the other party in writing of the nature and extent of the Force Majeure Event and its anticipated duration.

       "  'text': \"Although Enterprise Architecture (EA) has proven to have a certain durability, the same cannot be said for the ambitious newcomer that is agility. The regional government’s digital ambitions are considerable, and, in our opinion, their success will depend both on the agility as well as the robustness EA can provide.\\nWe therefore invited a panel of experience experts from the Government of Flanders to participate in a virtual workshop. The workshop had three objectives: \\nTo challenge and adjust our thought patterns where required;\\nAddress an as yet little-known theme;\\nAnd to use a paradox lens to introduce and test new ways of thinking.\\nThe uniqueness of a paradox lens is that it helps to make tensions open for discussion in a meaningful and workable manner. Tensions that are specific to the demanding and diverse field of contemporary business and public management.\\nIn the first part of the three-hour workshop, the emphasis was on several statements concerning EA and the role we attribute to this discipline. In the second part, we took it up a notch with the help of a virtual collaborative platform, testing the paradox lens on the workshop theme.\\nThe signal for the panel to – with a few philosophical detours – hold a mirror up to the research team and challenge each other to scrutinise EA practices within their respective organisations.\\nDefinition and scope of EA\\nAcademics like to start from solid definitions, something we have in common with enterprise architects, in fact. So it didn’t take long before the first terms were explained, and the requisite definitions were defined. The title of the workshop refers to the digital government. A desired outcome of the widespread deployment of the digital transformation in government today. But what do we understand under the term digital transformation?\\nIs digital transformation something we have known and done for some time now, since IT manifested itself within the organisation? Or is there something fundamentally different about the current advance of digital technologies and the way in which all sorts of applications influence and change society? Obviously, there is sufficient evidence for both options. Based on the discussion, our conclusion is that an acceleration is underway through unprecedented technology-driven change. This acceleration offers extraordinary opportunities for innovation that could fundamentally change sectors. It is precisely because of that that there is a need for a discipline that can deal with the complexity inherent to digital technology and organisational change.\\nThat is where EA comes in. In government, the disruptive force of digital technology offers the possibility to fundamentally restructure the service provisions and supporting processes. Over the years, the panel members have seen a shift from the operational – where efficiency is the code word – to the strategic, where digital transformation drastically impacts the organisational model and government services. The Government of Flanders has shown that this need not be a symbolic shift. Terms such as ‘low touch’ and ‘pro-activity’ have emerged, and the digital re-launch plan was recently presented with the purpose of catapulting the region to the top in terms of digitisation.\\nSo, back to EA. How do the panel members define the role of EA within the changing playing field of the digital government? In Flemish government, the discipline has apparently sustained some cuts and bruises here and there. Some are even unwilling to use the term EA. A far-reaching focus on compliance and modelling has given EA an accounting undertone. In some cases, architects were regarded as a club of obstructionists that put the brakes on innovation and the speed of change. However, the panel members emphasise that this is completely different nowadays: in principle, EA combines the strength of ideas, description and overview with an open mind focused on making complexity visible, facilitating innovation and achieving the digital vision of government organisations.\\nWhen we mentioned the meta-discipline of EA – that is the ability of EA to get other disciplines around the table and thread them together – the discussion among the panel discussion heated up. Declaring EA to be a discipline that transcends and acts as a guide for the other domains was apparently a step too far for our panel members. They prefer to think of EA as a discipline that supports decision-making and the implementation of a vision. A weapon to manage an organisation, but also to enable it to develop for a digital future. EA is positioned as a powerful tool to achieve the organisation’s objectives. What those objectives are is part of the strategic orientation of the specific government service or agency, but digital transformation invariably is a part of it.\\nConsidering the earlier definition of EA, we must take a closer look at the role of the enterprise architect. How can the architect best manifest themselves to fulfil their role as connector and ‘opportunity architect’? (See references below to earlier publications.) In other words, how can EA ensure that the organisation is ready to respond quickly and sustainably to opportunities and challenges around it? This is often referred to as agility, the codeword or buzzword to indicate the capacity to systematically identify opportunities and to quickly transform them into added value for citizens and other customers in the context of government. EA is thus a management tool that facilitates decision-making, ‘drill down’, and the division of complexity while allowing for various speeds within the organisation.\\nAccording to the panel, a good enterprise architect brings an arsenal of communication skills with them. They are proficient in clarifying complexity, supported by methodological expertise but – and this is relatively new – with an open mind and a view to the inevitable demand for innovation, change and renewal. Strictly speaking, one of the panel members argued, agility is conceivable and possible without EA, but this decision will come back to bite you fairly quickly in the form of errors, limited shelf life, increasing complexity and a lack of compatibility. So yes, EA should act as a backbone for an agile digital government and architect themselves must embody this premise.\\nTension and paradox\\nIn recent research, professors Stijn Viaene (Vlerick) and Lieselot Danneels (Ghent University) coined the term ‘management paradox’ and spoke about its usefulness when making choices in the context of digital transformations. Beware, a paradox is another type of dilemma, where a choice is, per definition, binary; it is a case of either/or. A paradox implies making a choice between two apparently contradictory interests, and yet people believe it is possible to find a good balance or accomplish both options in a creative manner. A well-known example is the field of tension between exploration and exploitation. People have since agreed that both should be emphasised simultaneously and that it is necessary to invest in both sides of the spectrum but in practice, there is tangible tension when this choice is raised.\\nThe aforementioned research indicates that digital transformation will mainly lead to a great many of such tensions. But if you can identify and understand a paradox, you can work with it. As such, managing paradoxes becomes the object of our attention. Can you make it clear to the organisation that the paradoxes linked to digital transformation are manageable? How can the shrewd enterprise architect expose paradoxes and help the organisation deal with them?\\nFor the panel it was an introduction to a new way of looking at digital transformation, and after some reflection, the panel members also warmed to the approach. Using generic paradox cards, they shared practical examples of familiar paradoxes: consider the tension between the reuse of existing assets – often dismissed as ‘legacy’ – and the development of new assets. Of the field of tension between autonomous employees and self-managing teams, and the need for coordination and alignment.\\nThe paradoxes the panel could identify most with – with a view to enterprise architecture – were the following:\\nOld and new: how do you work with the old while building the new?\\nIT efficiency and innovation: how do you strike a balance between efficiently managing IT resources and the need for resources for innovation within IT?\\nIT program agility and stability: how do you maintain a balance between an agile configuration of IT programs and the requisite mobility in an IT organisation?\\nThe article ‘Both/And Leadership’ from Harvard Business Review explains and summarises a few things. In the article, the authors advocate the value of paradox management and creating an equilibrium between forces that connect and forces that divide as a significant task for leadership in contemporary organisations. Things such as a common set of values and organisational culture can help when dealing with paradoxes. Given the ever-swelling wave of digital transformation and the associated turbulence, expectation are that the government manager will also want to apply the paradox lens.\\nThe panel concluded with a preview of next steps for research: a series of interviews with project managers to expose success factors in the reconciliation between agility and the role of EA. After all, the project level is the perfect level on which strategy is transformed into implementation and where strategic and operational choices in digital transformation can lead to tensions.\\nAuthors\\nJoachim Van den Bergh, Vlerick Business School\\nStijn Viaene, Vlerick Business School & KU Leuven\\nLieselot Danneels, Ghent University\\nPedro Meuleman, Elise Boone and Joachim Vanden Brande, AXI\\nWith thanks to the panel members on behalf of the Flemish Agencies for Local and Provincial Government, Growing Up, and Digital Flanders, as well as the Flemish Public Employment of Service of Flanders (VDAB).\\nReferences\\nThe blog by AXI with various articles about the digital government.\\nAn accessible article on ‘Both/And leadership’ ; Smith, Lewis & Tushman.\\nWhite paper: 'From enterprise architect to opportunity architect'\",\n",

       "  'text': 'When Nicolas Verschueren, Sven Van Overloop and Louis Vandendriessche decided to do their in-company project (ICP) for the Belgian engineering company Hamon, they knew nothing about cooling towers. “We all have a background in economics, so we spent the first three days on a crash course in cooling tower construction, air quality and heat recovery,” Nicolas recalls. “It was really weird how we were immediately sucked into the company.”\\n\"Grasp the technology\"\\nBernard nods: “If you want to understand the market Hamon is operating in, you have to fully grasp the technology as well. For the in-company project itself, I think it was also important to have a well-defined framework, so that you would feel a sense of responsibility and could really own it. And I must say you did that very well, not just in Belgium but also in India and China.”\\n\"Making the shift to a futureproof approach\"\\nThe three MIMS students’ assignment therefore met a real need at Hamon, as Bernard explains: “We were very good at capitalising on market opportunities, dynamics and market leads. But that was quite an opportunistic approach and it wasn’t futureproof. A large proportion of our market share was still in the coal business, but what if we wanted to shift to the gas and oil markets? What technologies did we need to invest in and what certifications were required?”\\nA game of two halves\\nThe project was split into two parts. “In the first phase, we worked with an interim manager to analyse Hamon’s global market and we devised a customer survey,” says Sven. “We then spent a fortnight in Mumbai and a week in both Shanghai and Beijing interviewing Hamon customers and prospects. We asked them why they would choose Hamon or one of its – often local – competitors. What did they think of the pricing and after-sales?”\\nFor the in-company project itself, I think it was also important to have a well-defined framework, so that you would feel a sense of responsibility and could really own it\\nHamon’s CEO\\nBuy-in from local teams\\nFortunately, the students could rely on the full support of both the interim manager and the local teams in India and China. “The local teams were well aware of why they were losing out on major contracts,” Louis recalls. “The price difference between Hamon and the competition was no longer in proportion to the difference in expertise. The technology has become much simpler and more standardised in the past few years, opening up the market to local low-cost companies. The local teams immediately bought into our project to inject a new lease of life into Hamon.”\\nHuge market potential in Asia\\nWhat was the actual outcome of the project? “Our global market research showed that Asia had huge market potential, which is why we went to India and China,” explains Nicolas. “But the customer interviews we conducted locally painted a different picture. Hamon was generally regarded as a high-quality player, but if the company didn’t change, it might as well forget about the Indian and Chinese markets.”\\nDynamic view of various sectors\\nFor Hamon, the students’ recommendations provided a blueprint for a new, more strategic market approach. Bernard explains: “Their report contained a dynamic view of various market sectors: current volumes, market trends and how Hamon should tackle the market. I reviewed their report with our people internally and put together an action plan with clear KPIs. Instead of chasing all the opportunities in the market, we now have a strategic view of the different sectors: which ones are easy for us to access, where we need to invest in new technologies or adapt to new regulations, and whether it’s profitable for us to do so.”\\nIn the meantime, Hamon has filed for another in-company project with Vlerick students. Deliverable of this project is a business plan for an innovative product that has been developed in the UK. What is the market potential in the rest of Western Europe? And how should Hamon target that market? To be continued.\\nFuture career impact\\nFor the three students, this in-company project was part of their Masters in International Management and Strategy (MIMS). How did their MIMS fit into their career plans?\\nNicolas: ‘This ICP was right up my street’\\n“I did a Bachelor’s degree in Economics at Maastricht. The year after that I did two internships in trading and marketing. For my Master’s degree, I opted for the MIMS. I’ve always been interested in international strategy, so this ICP was right up my street. Thanks to Vlerick, I have a better grasp of what’s going on around me in my professional life. The environment, the simulations and the people definitely helped me land my current job as pricing and top-line consultant.” \\nSven: ‘The world of start-ups and scale-ups opened up’\\n“My father is an expat and I’ve lived abroad all my life, so I’ve always been fascinated by international affairs. After doing a Master’s degree in Business Administration at Ghent University, I wanted to specialise in strategic consulting. MIMS ticked all the boxes. I followed quite a regimented study schedule for the five years I was at uni, so I relished the opportunity to do more project work and sharpen my soft skills at Vlerick. I used to think that if you wanted to work abroad, you had to get a job in a multinational. Vlerick helped me discover the world of start-ups and scale-ups, and opened my eyes to the opportunities there too. I now work as a business consultant for an IT company in Ghent. It’s a fairly small outfit but has a large international client base.” \\nLouis: ‘I discovered my passion for FMCG’\\n“After graduating at K.U. Leuven, I still missed the balance between the theoretical and practical side of the business world. At Vlerick, you’re surrounded by people who are eager to learn and willing to connect, which changes your mindset. Also, the global immersion trip to China and Japan allowed us to explore some great companies. But what really changed my life, is that I discovered my passion for fast-moving consumer goods. I’m currently doing a commercial traineeship at brewery Alken-Maes, where I can combine that passion for FMCG with my passion for beer.” \\nLearn more about our Masters in International Management & Strategy programme.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Despite the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, this year was no exception. While the Vlerick team worked remotely, they were tasked with developing an evidence-based and contextualised Business Game to train the employees of various Commercial First Aid (CoFA) departments associated with the various African Red Cross Societies with whom Rode Kruis-Vlaanderen has a partnership. Our students happily explain how their In-Company Project came to life and how they brought it to a successful end…\\nTHE BEGINNING OF OUR JOURNEY\\nBefore we start describing the challenge we had to tackle for Rode Kruis-Vlaanderen and the solution we came up with, we would like to briefly introduce ourselves. We are Victoire, Olivier and Leen. A team of three students finalising our Masters in International Management & Strategy at Vlerick Business School. Together, we were fortunate enough to be selected by Rode Kruis-Vlaanderen to work on their challenge for the duration of our In-Company project.\\nOur story begins several months ago on the Vlerick campus with a presentation from Arjan Keijser, not only a Vlerick alumnus himself, but also our future Red Cross supervisor. During this short presentation, all students from our programme were introduced to the amazing work done by Rode Kruis-Vlaanderen abroad and the philosophy of evidence-based practice that underpins all of it.\\nAfter a highly selective recruitment process, we were able to kick off our project mid-April. Under the guidance of Arjan Keijser, Project Manager First Aid Blended Learning, our task was to develop an interactive Business Game that Rode Kruis-Vlaanderen can use to teach the employees of local CoFA departments the basics of running successful commercial organizations.\\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF COMMERCIAL FIRST AID\\nYou might wonder why Rode Kruis-Vlaanderen is offering support for the development of commercial operations to its Red Cross partners in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is a valid question to raise, as the various Red Cross Societies are primarily humanitarian actors tasked with providing essential services to the populations they serve.\\nThis mission however, does not preclude the Red Cross from engaging in commercial activities. Indeed, in Flanders the Red Cross is a well-known provider of Commercial First Aid trainings to companies. Commercial activities like this allow the various Red Cross Societies around the world to leverage their expertise and achieve a degree of financial sustainability that would otherwise elude them.\\nRode Kruis-Vlaanderen therefore supports other National Societies in setting up such revenue-generating activities. By supporting our African partners like this, they are able to create a sustainable form of financing which strengthens their resilience and makes them less dependent on government subsidies, donations, and Western funding to finance their much needed humanitarian work.\\nTHE COMMERCIAL FIRST AID BUSINESS GAME\\nRunning such a CoFA department is not an easy task however and requires the right mixture of soft and hard skills. No one is born with these skills, they have to be acquired through hard work. That is exactly where our project comes: develop a Business Game with a focus on Commercial First Aid.\\nFor the Commercial First Aid Business Game to succeed, Rode Kruis-Vlaanderen also defined seven specific requirements for us to take into account during the development process:\\nRelevant to our target audience and goal.\\nBased on the latest scientific insights in the fields of education, communication sciences and economics.\\nHighly interactive, hands-on and varied.\\nGender-neutral and appropriately contextualised to the Sub-Sahara African countries in which Rode Kruis-Vlaanderen is active.\\nInexpensive and low-tech, so that it could even be played without internet and/or regular access to electricity.\\nHighly modular and scalable, as it must be possible for the facilitators to adapt the game to the specific needs of participants, environment and timeframe.\\nAble to allow for clear measurement of the progress and working points of participants.\\nThese seven principles had to be translated into (at the very least) a clear manual for instructors, a booklet with key take-aways for participants and slide decks and other supporting materials to use while teaching the various modules. With these objectives firmly established, we hit the ground running. We started by conducting research into the organisational context in which the game would take place. Up next was a deep dive into the academic literature around gamification, business games, social enterprises, and education in Africa, to meet the BRC-FL’s high standards for using only evidence-based tools. To supplement this literature review, we conducted interviews with experts in the aforementioned topics, and with representatives of National Societies from Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\\nFrom these interviews, it soon became clear that we needed to create modules on Human Resources, Strategy, Marketing, Accounting, Sales, and Negotiation. After identifying key learning objectives for each module, we transformed these learnings into a variety of game formats ranging from simulations to role-plays and case studies. The next step was writing the overall storyline of the Business Game, which formed the connective tissue between the various modules. This storyline had to be as realistic as possible to maximise the participants’ engagement and motivation. We eventually came up with a simulation in which the participants build a new CoFA department from scratch and have to grow their business. By the end of the week, the participants would be able to see which team ran their newly developed CoFA department in the best way.\\nOnce the modules were ready, we validated these through extensive user-testing. Playing the various modules with representatives of the African National Societies we had interviewed allowed us to tailor the content and style of the CoFA Business Game even more to the needs of their end-users. To enable future incremental improvements to our Business Game, we also developed a system of surveys to measure the learning outcomes and identify areas of improvement.\\nTHE END OF OUR JOURNEY\\nFor the past two months, we have been hard at work developing our materials. In the end, we delivered over 265 pages of instructor guidelines and participant booklets, a methodological report of 88 pages, nine different slide decks (247 slides in total), four surveys and twelve types of extra tools and templates that the participants can take home with them to implement and optimize their business procedures. Collaborating with Rode Kruis-Vlaanderen has been an insightful experience for us and the ideal steppingstone to finalise our education in International Management & Strategy.\\nWe were particularly impressed by the commitment of Rode Kruis-Vlaanderen to leverage their expertise to aid the Sub-Saharan African National Societies and we also greatly appreciated the dedication shown by the Red Cross staff to the success and wellbeing of our team. Next to this, we highly appreciated working on a concrete project that will go on to have tangible impact for many years to come. It was immensely satisfying to see how our work was received with a lot of enthusiasm by the representatives of the various African National Societies we interviewed.\\nSTUDENTS' BIO:\\nLeen van Hees graduated from KU Leuven (Belgium) with a Master’s in Economics and is currently enrolled in the Masters in International Management & Strategy at Vlerick Business School. Before joining Rode Kruis-Vlaanderen’s in-company project, she spent time in Benin and in Peru as a humanitarian volunteer. Particularly interested in the African context, she wrote her thesis on the influence of female autonomy on the occurrence of intimate partner violence in Tanzania. \\nVictoire Terlinden studied Art History at the Ecole du Louvre (France) and is currently enrolled in the Masters in International Management & Strategy at Vlerick Business School. During her previous education, African visual culture was one of her main fields of interest and she participated – among other things – in the design of an exhibition dedicated to Mauritanian ironworks.\\nOlivier D’hondt graduated from KU Leuven (Belgium) with a Master’s in Business Economics and is currently enrolled in the Masters in International Management & Strategy at Vlerick Business School. His previous internships at Deloitte and Zensor allowed him to gain experience in sales, marketing, and strategy, three fields of particular interest to CoFA Business Game Rode Kruis-Vlaanderen wanted to develop.\",\n",

A great example of how we bring their values to our work is our Organon Technology and Society Research Insights Partnership.

By doing this kind of responsible research, we believe we can contribute to a better understanding of the impact of ‘good’ health technology on society.\\nDisease-modifying therapies (DMT) are becoming increasingly accessible in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. However, for them to be effective, early diagnosis is crucial. Is the Belgian healthcare infrastructure able to diagnose early enough? There is a high unmet clinical and social need for treatment for this disease. But adopting DMTs may require a transformation of Belgian healthcare practice. This health policy-preparing paper is the result of a Belgian Early Alzheimer Disease Round Table, as well as an anonymised memory clinics survey and a computer simulation. Through dialogue with all stakeholders, it presents workable solutions for expensive but curing therapies.\\nAlthough it seems counterintuitive, our research indicates that without confidential price agreements, lower income countries will pay up to 12% higher prices for innovative medicines that richer countries. They also gain access to them far later than richer countries. These are the findings of a simulation model, developed by Vlerick Business School, in partnership with the IMT School for Advanced Studies in Lucca, Italy. They challenge the assumption that total price transparency leads to more competition, lower prices for all – and greater availability of these medicines for more people.\\nHorizon scanning is understood to be an important part of a demand-driven healthcare system. This policy paper proposes a two-stage approach to the national scanning process. If adopted, the proposals would lead to better management of healthcare budgets – particularly in an environment where innovative, high-cost therapies are likely to emerge. The paper suggests a pilot in Belgium.\\nThe Covid pandemic stretched the public health structures and mechanisms of the European Union to breaking point – particularly those dealing with emergencies. It revealed a need for deeper union and collaboration across the European healthcare sector – and for a significant financial cushion for rapid funding.

       "  'text': 'History meets modernity\\nThe Great Seminary, which houses our campus, was completed in 1914. Before seminary students could use it, however, German troops turned it into a barracks. The first seminarist took up residence in 1926. In 2003, the building was given a new purpose as Vlerick campus. The stained glass windows and religious statues of the deconsecrated chapel now share space with cutting-edge facilities – including 25 breakout rooms and eight lecture spaces. \\nAn inspiring setting\\nEnter our campus, and you’ll find yourself in the atrium – a secluded courtyard where students and faculty gather to eat lunch, catch up on reading and relax. You’ll also see a magnificent piece of art – Italian Life by Panamarenko, one of Belgium’s most important sculptors and visual artists – on the floor of the atrium. You’ll be surprised and delighted by ancient and modern art throughout our campus – which is a truly creative and inspirational place to study.\\nDiscover a wealth of knowledge and information\\nAccess the latest research, prepare for classes or just quench your thirst for knowledge at the library. We have a vast collection of print publications and online resources that span the whole spectrum of business and management topics. There’s also space for silent study, reading and working. If you’re looking for a quiet spot to concentrate, head to the library loft – its cosy sofas, coffee tables and bar stools make it feel like you’re in your own living room. \\nRecharge your batteries\\nAt the end of a busy day of learning, it’s nice to take some time to relax and reflect. And the enclosed garden is the perfect spot. Take a break on one of the picnic tables, meet up with colleagues for group work – or channel your energy into a game of ping pong. \\nFood to power your learning\\nThe ancient seminary refectory now houses a fine dining restaurant for our executive education participants. We hold events here too. Separately, at ground floor level, our spacious lounge is a great space for lunch – offering sandwiches and other cold and hot snacks. We also have a bar where you can catch up with friends and discuss your day. \\nHow to find us\\nReep 1 \\n9000 Ghent \\nOpening hours \\nMonday to Thursday: 8 AM – 6 PM \\nFriday: 8 AM – 3.30 PM\\nAdjusted opening hours in July and August: Monday-Thursday 9-12 AM and 1-5 PM, Friday 9-12 AM\\nFAQs\\nWhere can I park?\\nThe Reep underground car park is right next to our campus.

While these financial indicators are undoubtedly important, they only provide a partial picture of a business's growth and success. Many more intangible factors can indicate growth, such as employee satisfaction, customer satisfaction, product quality or innovation efforts. Neglecting these equally critical growth measures can lead to blind spots. And over time, they may hinder a company's ability to thrive and innovate.\\nWhy business leaders should monitor multiple measures of growth\\nResearch by the Vlerick Entrepreneurship Academy shows that many entrepreneurs overlook growth measures such as employee and customer satisfaction, product quality or innovation. Professor of Entrepreneurship Yannick Dillen delves into why these measures are crucial and how neglecting them could be detrimental to the growth of your business.\\nFour out of ten entrepreneurs do not measure employee and customer satisfaction. Is this surprising?\\nOne of the survey's key findings is that only 60% of the entrepreneurs consistently measure employee and customer satisfaction. This is a striking insight, as the satisfaction of both employees and customers is integral to long-term business success. Satisfied employees are more engaged, productive, and loyal, contributing to lower employee turnover rates and a healthier work environment. Satisfied customers are more likely to become repeat buyers and sources of valuable feedback. Failing to measure these aspects means missing out on opportunities for improvement and growth. Without feedback from employees and customers, entrepreneurs may not fully understand the obstacles or areas for improvement within their business, ultimately limiting their growth potential.\\nProduct quality and innovation efforts seem to be neglected factors too. Why are these so important for measuring company growth?\\nProduct quality is the cornerstone of a company's reputation and long-term viability. Yet approximately half of the surveyed entrepreneurs do not consistently measure this factor. A business producing high-quality products or services is likelier to enjoy customer loyalty, positive reviews, and word-of-mouth referrals. Ignoring this metric can lead to quality degradation over time, which can be detrimental to customer satisfaction and, consequently, to business growth.\\nInnovation, on the other hand, can be considered the lifeblood of sustained business growth. Yet only a quarter of the entrepreneurs in the survey track the number of innovations in their pipeline. Innovation drives competitiveness, expands product lines, and opens new markets. Failing to measure innovation can lead to stagnation, making it difficult to pivot in response to market changes or take advantage of emerging opportunities.\\nWhat might be the reason that many entrepreneurs are neglecting these metrics?\\nMeasuring employee and customer satisfaction, product quality, and innovation is admittedly more challenging than tracking revenue or profit. These metrics are often intangible, and their impact may not be immediately quantifiable. To measure these intangibles, entrepreneurs can employ a range of methods, including surveys, feedback mechanisms, quality control processes, and innovation pipelines. Investing in the right tools and systems to collect and analyse this data can provide invaluable insights and guide strategic decision-making.\\nWhat is your main takeaway from the survey results?\\nBusiness growth is not solely about the numbers on a financial statement.
