Incredibly intense. Incredibly challenging. Incredibly successful. We invested in the expansion and operation of our networks to the tune of some 18 billion euros. Consequently, by the end of the year, we had made our 5G network in Germany available to more than 90 percent of the population, for example, and we also further increased our 5G network lead over our competitors in the United States. We attracted millions of new customers and delivered strong financial results. Deutsche Telekom is one of the most valu- able brands in the world and we are currently the leading Euro- pean telecommunications provider by a very considerable margin. Once again, successes such as these are a great incentive to me to ensure we also take a leading role in relation to our social and ecological responsibility. ¡°Act responsibly¡± is a key and integral component of our Group Timotheus Httges, Chairman of the Board of Management, Bonn, Germany strategy. To underline the growing relevance of sustainable action, Michael Hagspihl, as Head of Corporate Responsibility, has We are working with our suppliers to make our product range reported to me directly since January 1, 2022.

By as early as 2025, we will be climate-neutral at Deutsche Telekom. What¡¯s more, by no later than 2040, we will be climate-neutral along the entire value chain. We have already achieved one of our initial targets. Our customers are now using our green Deutsche Telekom network to surf the net ¨C and this is the case throughout the Group. We will be judged by our progress. Since 2021, the Board of Management¡¯s remuneration has also been dependent on us meeting our climate targets.

Strategy 5 Foreword Despite the fact that the torrents of water also caused severe dam- age to our infrastructure in the affected areas, we were able to restore more than 96 percent of fixed network connections by the end of 2021. Our technicians provided interim solutions while the rebuilding work was being carried out. We won¡¯t stop until everyone can #TAKEPART. This means not only ensuring technical access to fast networks, but also boosting people¡¯s ability to use digital media proficiently. We are working to ensure that all people have equal opportunity to be a part of the digital society. That¡¯s why, in 2021, we continued our campaign against online hate and for more online civil courage. We report extensively on these and many other sustainability activities in this year¡¯s Sustainability Report. We remain committed to the principles of the United Nations Global Compact and the German Sustainability Code. Both of these frameworks, along with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, guide us in what we do. Digitalization offers many opportunities ¨C it creates potential for protecting the climate and conserving resources, simplifies our working world, and enriches our personal everyday lives. We at Deutsche Telekom are working to bring about digitalization ori- ented to people and values. I would like to thank all those who are helping to shape our journey as we advance into a more sustaina- ble digital future ¨C our employees, customers, partners, and share- holders alike.

During the year under review, we brought many of our CR topics together under the headings #GreenMagenta and #GoodMa- genta, with the aim of positioning our commitment to sustainabil- ity more strongly in our communication with stakeholder groups such as employees and customers. We also use these two catego- ries to label products and initiatives of ours that bring sustainabil- ity benefits. These labels help us increase the transparency of our CR communication. We also aim to increase transparency for CR experts by bringing our CR strategy in line with the ESG perspec- tives. You can find additional information on our Group strategy in the 2021 annual report. Our CR (Corporate Responsibility) strategy is derived from the Group strategy. During the year under review, we have continued to refine our CR strategy.

Strategy 9 CR strategy & management Our management tools ¨C the ESG key performance indicators Development of our ESG KPIs ESG KPIs (key performance indicators) are used as management tools for our CR activities. Since they are highly relevant, we also publish them in the combined non-financial statement of our annual report. Our national companies assist in the collection of Group-wide ESG KPIs by recording CR data themselves. These national companies represent 99 percent of the Group¡¯s net revenue. For the purpose of integrated financial and sustainability reporting, the KPIs map all six types of capital (see diagram).

Our Group is broken down into five operating segments: We are convinced that commercial, social, and ecological aspects can complement each other. We aim to make a positive contribu- tion to sustainable development throughout our entire value chain. The overall responsibility for Corporate Responsibility (CR) lies with our Board of Management; it deliberates and decides on important matters pertaining to CR. The Group Corporate Respon- sibility (GCR) department develops Group-wide policies and guidelines with the goal of steadily advancing the corporate cul- ture with regard to sustainable innovation and social responsibility. As of January 1, 2022, GCR has been transferred from the Human Resources and Legal Affairs Board department into the area of the Chief Executive Officer. By taking this step, and including ESG targets in Board of Management remuneration, we are again high- lighting the great importance that Corporate Responsibility has for our Group. Reporting against standards In connection with the move, Birgit Klesper, who has headed the CR department for 13 years, as Senior Vice President for Group Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Corporate Responsibility, will hand over the leadership of the GRI 102-1, GRI 102-2, GRI 102-6, GRI 102-7, GRI 102-18, GRI 102-1, department to Michael Hagspihl. Birgit Klesper has helped the Group reach key milestones in efforts to enshrine CR in Group GRI 102-20 (General Disclosures) principles, and to emphasize the importance of CR. These accom- plishments range from development of the company¡¯s CR strategy to integration of ¡°Act responsibly¡± within the Group strategy. Numerous successes such as the following demonstrate that Deutsche Telekom is well on its way to becoming a leading sus- tainable telco: we are listed in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, as the third-best telecommunications company worldwide, and as the best in Europe; we are included, for the 6th time in a row, in CDP¡¯s ¡°A List for Climate Change,¡± in recognition of our efforts to combat climate change; and we are the recipient of intense media coverage, and of a highly positive public reception, for our policies and activities against online hate speech, discrimination, and fake news. Birgit Klesper retired as of January 1, 2022. In order to always ensure a direct exchange between CR and our core busi- ness, the CR Board advises GCR. This board is made up of the heads of the main Group units.

It also helps us to bid on new projects in which potential commercial customers require their suppliers to provide HSE certificates. Our Group-level HSE management system is covered by an umbrella certificate based on the international standards ISO 45001 (formerly OHSAS 18001) for occupational health and safety and ISO 14001 for environmental management. For some units, it also covers international standard ISO 9001 for quality manage- ment. Some of the national companies are not covered by an umbrella certificate because they have their own certifications, some of which are even more comprehensive. This is the case in Greece, for example. The OTE Group has an integrated management system. In addition to the above-mentioned standards, it also covers the international standards ISO 50001 for energy management and ISO 27001 for data security.

In the case of many topics that are highly important, pursuant to our materiality analysis, the pertinent risks for our company are com- prehensively evaluated by the responsible person(s) within the Group ¨C such as staff in the areas of Compliance or Data Privacy. Such supplementary analysis gives us a clearer perspective of the relevant impacts on the environment and society, and it helps us to pair our risk analysis with strategic opportunity assessment. On the basis of the most important sustainability issues involved, we have developed various possible scenarios. In one, for example, disruptive, new products can help solve existing social, economic or ecological problems. On the other hand, adverse environmental impacts, such as larger quantities of produced waste, can increase costs (in this case, costs for waste management). Such scenarios have been evaluated by experts in terms of their probability of occurrence and their financial impacts. On the basis of such evalu- ation, the risks and opportunities linked to the scenarios have been grouped into the categories ¡°low,¡± ¡°medium¡± and ¡°high.¡± The analysis indicates that, currently, the supply chain and cli- mate-related issues present high risks for society, for the environ- ment and for us as a company ¨C for example, pollutants released in the supply chain can adversely affect human health, and tighter legal requirements can lead to higher costs for us. For years now, these issues have been taken into account in Deutsche Telekom¡¯s overarching risk-and-opportunity management process, and they are reported in detail each year in our annual report. On the other hand, our products and services can help solve ecological and social challenges. For example, we offer solutions that help reduce energy consumption. Such challenges, therefore, offer opportuni- ties for sustainable development, as well as market opportunities for us.

The guide presents best practices, methods, and tips for applying the AI Guidelines to develop- ment processes. With this guide, we are seeking to ensure that all developers who work with AI are able to conform to the AI Guidelines and implement them in the systems and products they develop. The Robust AI Assessment project is part of our overarching efforts to link state-of-the-art technologies to ethical stand- ards. In a cooperative effort with experts of Israel¡¯s Ben Gurion University, and the German start-up Neurocat, AI experts of Telekom Innovation Laboratories are working to measure and analyze the robustness of internal and external AI-based prod- ucts and services, with a view to identifying potential for improvements. In addition, we have added the AI Guidelines to the curricula for various training courses for our employees.

In 2020, we launched and further developed the ¡°Compliance Next Level¡± transformation initiative, with a view to preparing our Compliance organization for growing customer requirements, both internal and external, and for digital and agile modes of work. Since October 2021, the Group Compliance Management area has been using agile work processes.

In order to drive network expansion, network operators in Germany need investment incentives, legal and regulatory planning security, and technological freedom of action. That enables them to respond flexibly to the circumstances of enterprises and house- holds and meet political, economic, and social requirements. This is the only way to fully harness the potential for cost-effective private network expansion using all available technologies. When it comes to areas where cost-effective broadband expansion is not possible, it is up to the public sector to ensure the gaps are plugged by providing technology- and supplier-neutral funding programs and exercising sound judgment. Legal frameworks and regulatory practice need to actively support private-sector investment in new fiber-optic networks and prevent unnecessary financial burdens and red tape for the network operators investing in networks. In view of the fact that the internet and telecommunications markets are converging rapidly, and in light of the growing market power of a few global internet players, the sector-specific regula- tion of telecommunications that has been pursued to date is creating more and more of an imbalance. The same laws and regulations that apply to telecommunications companies also need to apply to internet companies providing the same services. The objective here must be to create equal competitive conditions and enable fair distribution of the financial burden involved in broadband expansion.

In such matters, it focuses par- ticularly on directly clarifying any unresolved issues related to tax Economy 52 Sustainable finance Put simply, the Total Tax Contribution addresses the contributions as a whole to the financing of the public domain that are made in connection with, or are a result of, enterprises and entrepreneurial activities. In this respect not only are the taxes levied on the profit of the enterprise or group of companies taken into account, further types of taxes are also addressed, which can be quite substantial, in particular also in the telecommunications sector. Moreover, the so-called ¡°Taxes Borne¡± as well as so-called ¡°Taxes Collected¡± are included in the approach in order to comprehensively visualize the financial weight of the enterprise and its activity for the public domain. For example, it also illustrates the aspects of employment and value-added through the presentation of wage taxes, social contributions and value-added taxes. As a consequence, a differ- entiated and therefore meaningful picture results regarding the positive financial impact on the public community in connection with the enterprise and its activity. In addition, this approach can also show national differences in the tax frameworks. Further information regarding the EBTF as well as the PwC survey can be found at https://ebtforum.org and https://www.pwc.com/ gx/en/services/tax/publications/total-tax-contribution-framework. html. Under both links, explanations and details regarding the defi- nition of the Total Tax Contribution are also given, for example with respect to the concepts of Taxes Collected and Taxes Borne and further breakdowns of the Total Tax Contribution, as well as a pres- entation of the findings of the survey carried out by PwC. The following charts show the Total Tax Contribution 2020 of the Research and development group companies addressed. As a future-oriented telecommunications business, we support and participate in ongoing research. We collaborate with various universities. For example, we established a professorship for soft- ware engineering (with a focus on blockchain) at the CODE Univer- sity of Applied Sciences in Berlin. We invest in various fields of research such as the Internet of Things (IoT). We invested a total of 33 million euros in research and development within the Group in 2021. We promote young and innovative business ideas. In the frame- work of our hubraum technology incubator, start-ups benefit from our experience, receive financial support and obtain access to exclusive technologies. We bring young participating companies together with relevant business units within the Group, for the pur- pose of testing innovative technologies and new business models and bringing them to the market. In 2021, our technology incuba- tor collaborated with about 100 start-ups. With our Deutsche Telekom hubraum 5G ¡°Sustainability Award,¡± we highlight efforts by industry and start-ups to bring about a sus- tainable world. The award honors projects with a focus on the sus- tainability of 5G networks, such as projects in the areas of smart infrastructure and AI-controlled (AI = artificial intelligence) energy management. In the year under review, hubraum, in cooperation with Bundesver- band Deutsche Startups (German start-ups association), produced a study of AI-oriented start-ups in Germany that highlights the promise and strengths of the German AI ecosystem. The study\\'s Economy 53 Sustainable finance key results include the finding that young AI companies, while enormously ambitious, tend to lack resources and impetus for growth. At the same time, the study also found that women are underrepresented in the AI sector, and that this situation needs to change, in light of the need for participatory, unbiased AI systems ¨C and of the insight that diversity in AI-developer teams reduces bias in the resulting AI systems. In this regard, the study was able to offer a positive outlook, by reporting that 81 percent of AI start-ups believe that AI-technology development needs to take account of ethical issues.

Economy 54 Suppliers Suppliers Our approach to sustainable procurement Encompassing the entire procurement process, our Group-wide sustainable procurement strategy is put into action using internal and external performance indicators and management tools. Until the end of 2021, the responsibility for ensuring sustaina- bility in procurement lay with the following two Board of Man- agement departments: a) Finance and b) Human Resources and Legal Affairs. As of January 1, 2022, this responsibility now lies with the Chairman of the Board of Management¡¯s depart- ment and the Board of Management department for Finance.

Auditing procedures We focus our audit activities on strategically important and par- ticularly risky suppliers. They are routinely audited every two to three years. This group includes roughly 250 of our 20 000 or so active suppliers. Together, they cover around 80 percent of our procurement volume. These audits give us transparency about the risks in large parts of our supply chain. Economy 57 Suppliers The majority of the audits are conducted within the scope of Joint 2021 audit results Audit Cooperation (JAC).

This has secured our place on the Supplier Engagement Leader Board. An important step in achieving this was calculating the supplier- specific emission intensities based on supplier responses to the CDP Supply Chain Program. This involved calculating the ratio between a supplier¡¯s overall emissions (Scopes 1 and 2 and Scope 3 for the upstream supply chain) and the supplier¡¯s overall sales. The ESG KPI ¡°CDP Supply Chain Program¡± indicates the degree to which our procurement volume from carbon-intensive suppliers is covered by the CDP Supply Chain Program.

Responsible procurement of raw materials We require our suppliers to protect the environment and use resources responsibly. This requirement is enshrined both in our ¡°Code of Human Rights & Social Principles¡± and in our Supplier Code of Conduct. As a form of verification, we request our suppliers to disclose information about their activities and we perform supplier audits (social audits). In these audits, we check whether our suppliers use an environmental management system, including a waste man- agement system, and review how they manage their energy and water consumption. In addition, we always check whether there is a management system in place to address the issue of conflict resources. When selecting suppliers and products, we review and evaluate, for example, the use of hazardous and conflict materials ¨C espe- cially in light of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains.

Continued analysis of our products¡¯ sustainability benefits To date, there is no industry-wide established system that provides sustainability information about ICT products and services. Since 2014 at Deutsche Telekom, we have been using an in-house analy- sis method to assess the sustainability of our products. This includes, for example, examining the safety of the products, or how well they can be recycled. We inform our customers about how our products are contributing to sustainability. The results of our analyses also allow us to posi- tion ourselves as a responsible company with respect to the com- petition. In the reporting year, we also included selected products in the analysis along the criteria of the EU taxonomy. Correlation with SDGs In the year under review, we reviewed ¨C with support from experts ¨C the sustainability benefits of a number of our products in light of the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The degree of detail depended on the revenue generated with the product under review. If revenues were high, we considered the impact on all SDGs. Where revenues were limited, we only took the impact on the most relevant SDG into account.

Economy 64 Sustainable and innovative products Deutsche Telekom supports companies, municipalities, and schools in accessing financial support available for forward- looking investments Digitalization offers enormous opportunities. Throughout a spec- trum ranging from the Internet of Things (IoT) to big data and arti- ficial intelligence, digital technologies and solutions are facilitating the development of innovative products that have greater energy efficiency and/or durability and can simplify production and work processes. Also, as the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, digitalized companies and municipalities are more resilient ¨C and better able to handle challenges and crises. In summer 2020, the German Government approved a ¡°Future Package,¡± an extensive economic stimulus package designed to stabilize the German economy and equip Germany for the future. The package, which includes a raft of measures aimed at support- ing digitalization in private-sector companies, the public sector, and education, boosts Germany¡¯s existing funding scene with far- reaching additional impetus. Under the effort, Germany¡¯s federal and Lnder (state) governments are subsidizing digitalization pro- jects at rates of up to 70 percent of the relevant costs (and even more, in some cases). Deutsche Telekom is also seeking to provide additional impetus in the area of funding, and thereby support companies, municipali- ties, and schools even more effectively in their digital transforma- tion processes. Our Group program ¡°Schubkraft¡± (¡°Thrust¡±) (only available in German), for example, offers free pertinent advising, along with practical support in accessing funding opportunities. With our Quick-Check service (only available in German), compa- nies can quickly determine, at no charge, whether their projects are eligible for funding, as well as what funding programs are suit- able for the projects. The service is available both online and in the ¡°Meine Frderung¡± (¡°My Funding¡±) app. In addition, we offer indi- vidual consultations, provide support (in cooperation with part- ners) for application processes and assist companies in preparing digitalization plans that can serve as a basis for obtaining funding. Our efforts on behalf of the non-profit association BePro Velbert e. V. provide a good example of our activities in this area. hanks to the funding it received, this association has been able to move forward significantly with digitalization. For example, it is now using a digi- tal point of sale (POS) system. BePro Velbert offers job opportuni- ties to long-term unemployed persons, and thereby helps them to re-enter the workplace. In order to stay in touch with the modern workplace, the association regularly invests in new equipment. One case in point involved the said digital POS system. Via a con- tact to Deutsche Telekom¡¯s sales area, the association was put in touch with the company¡¯s ¡°Schubkraft¡± team. Then, in a customer workshop, the vision and the framework for the association¡¯s pro- ject were discussed. In a next step, ¡°Schubkraft¡± researched the available funding programs and helped the association submit its application. Shortly thereafter, the association¡¯s funding applica- tion was approved.

We follow the coverage requirements of Bundesnetzagentur (BNetzA, Federal Network Agency) in expanding the mobile net- work. By the end of 2021, we provided almost 99 percent of households with LTE coverage. In addition, we have been providing broadband service, with bandwidth of 50 or 100 Mbps, along more and more traffic routes. Already, over 90 percent of people in Germany now have access to Deutsche Telekom\\'s fast, new 5G mobile network.

We slightly missed the target of achieving 99 percent LTE coverage in Europe by 2021 with a value of 98.2 percent and instead continued to drive for- ward the further development of our networks with 5G and FTTH. Furthermore, more than 34.5 million households in Germany can already order a rate with up to 100 Mbit/s on our fixed network. Economy 66 Network expansion and wireless service for 250 000 people was temporarily dis- Number of fixed network customers rupted. Cellular capacities were then increased using mobile masts and special antennas fitted to existing masts. As a result of these efforts, cellular service was completely restored in the flood- damaged areas within the space of only a week. In addition, some 97 percent of the 103 000 fixed network accesses that had been destroyed were repaired by the end of the year. As a stopgap measure, we provide affected customers with free LTE or hybrid routers, along with unlimited data allowances for calling and inter- net usage. In the hardest-hit regions, existing copper-wire accesses that had been damaged or destroyed are not being restored; instead, they are being replaced with fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) fiber-optic accesses. As part of these efforts, we plan to install some 40 000 new fiber-optic accesses in the states of Rhineland-Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia. In January 2022, we began this fiber- optic expansion in the cities of Dernau, Mayschoss, and Rech. In 2022, an additional 25 000 FTTH accesses will be added. Reporting against standards Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) TC-TL-550a.2 (Managing Systemic Risks from Technology Disruptions) Rollout of the new 5G mobile generation A total of 63 000 antennas are now operating at the 5G standard in Deutsche Telekom¡¯s network (as of December 2021). As of the end of 2021 this new mobile communications standard was availa- ble to over 90 percent of all households in Germany. Most of the antennas transmit on the 2.1 GHz frequency, both in large cities and in smaller communities and rural areas. 5G on the fast 3.6 GHz frequency band is available in more than 140 cities (as of December 2021). 3 600 antennas are now in place, at a total of over 1 200 locations. As a result, more and more people are now able to enjoy high-speed 5G service. Deutsche Telekom decommissioned its 3G network in Germany in 2021. The frequencies that have become available as a result are now being used for 5G and LTE service. In other words, more band- width is now available for these two newer, and considerably more powerful, technologies. Continuing expansion of the fiber-optic network Deutsche Telekom¡¯s fiber-optic network is the largest in Europe, with a length of over 650 000 kilometers in Germany alone (as of December 2021). As global data traffic continues to grow rapidly, we are continuing to expand our fiber-optic network. To do this as quickly and efficiently as possible, we use planning software and modern deployment methods such as trenching. We use our expansion tracker for Germany (only available in German) to illus- trate our progress. To expand the fiber-optic network, we are using FTTC (fiber to the curb) technology with super vectoring and are expanding FTTH (fiber to the home) as well.

Economy 68 Customer satisfaction Our surveys are conducted either directly after a contact (for example, via the hotline, in a shop, on a field service call, or after an online inquiry by email or chat) or a completed process (for exam- ple, after service provisioning). If a customer tells us in a survey that their request has not yet been resolved, a callback offer is made to clarify the request once and for all. The results of customer surveys are also used for internal training of our customer advisors. Measuring customer retention and endorsement We use the TRI*M index to gauge customer retention and regularly participate in benchmarking. The recorded data is based on a cus- tomer survey conducted in all markets and segments (except T-Mobile US). To measure the TRI*M value, customers are asked four standardized questions ¨C for example, whether they would recommend Deutsche Telekom to others; their answers are com- piled in a key performance indicator. The TRI*M value for the Deutsche Telekom Group is calculated as an overall value from the individual measurement results of the countries or segments. At the end of the year under review, the indicator for the Group (excluding T-Mobile US) came in at 73.4 points versus an adjusted value of 72.7 points at the start of the year (both determined on a comparable basis). As a result, the index value improved, and we achieved our Group aim of increasing it slightly. The Germany and T-Systems operating segments contributed to the positive devel- opment with improvements in customer loyalty. The TRI*M index for Germany, at 69.2 points, is slightly higher than in the previous year (69.0). Also, it is considerably higher, for both consumers and business customers, than the comparable figures of the competition. In our EU business segment, we experienced a slight decrease, from 68.6 to 68.4, while the TRI*M index for T-Systems increased from 87 to 90 points. In sum, we once again reached our overall goal of a slight increase for the Group as a whole. Our goal for 2022 is to achieve another slight increase for the Group as a whole. Customer satisfaction and loyalty scores are factored into both the long-term variable remuneration scheme for our board members and, to an extent, the performance assessments of our managers, meaning some of their variable salary components are linked to these ratings.

Economy 71 Consumer protection The effects of EMFs have been thoroughly researched over the past decades in numerous scientific studies. The World Health Organization (WHO) analyzes the findings of scientific research and most recently made a statement regarding the results in 2014. In its statement, it concludes that the current threshold values for EMFs ensure that mobile communications technology can be used safely and further development should be accompanied by research. In 2020, after evaluating current scientific research, the ICNIRP once again confirmed the protection concept for EMFs, as they occur in mobile communications. According to ICNIRP, the threshold values ensure comprehensive protection for people and the environment. This also applies to frequency ranges used by 5G, because, like earlier network types, 5G requires high security standards. Safe operation of mobile communications technology in Germany is therefore ensured. In 2021, the online portal Informationszentrum Mobilfunk (center for information about mobile communications), working in cooper- ation with three municipal umbrella associations, expanded its offerings for municipalities and published a new brochure (only available in German), entitled ¡°Mobile communications and health¡± (¡°Mobilfunk und Gesundheit¡±), for municipal decision-makers. In addition, working in cooperation with various media, the portal carried out informational events, and an experts¡¯ conference for representatives of Bavarian municipalities, on the expansion of 5G network service. At the end of 2021, Informationszentrum Mobilfunk (only available in German) published a video on socially relevant 5G applications. In cooperation with the three other 5G licensees in Germany, Telef¨®nica Germany, Vodafone, and 1&1 Mobilfunk, we support Informationszentrum Mobilfunk. The portal provides objective, scientifically reliable information about basic issues relating to mobile communications, including controversial issues, in the areas of health and safety, technology and network expansions, the environment and sustainability, and politics and legal ques- tions.

The findings of the survey are used, for example, to determine the Security Awareness Index (SAI) and the Data Protection Award indicator. The indicators help us to review the effectiveness of our measures in the areas of IT security and data protection. The data protection award indicator was last measured in 2020 and stood at 86 percent (without T-Mobile US). In the last survey in 2021, security awareness reached 80.9 (without T-Mobile US) of maxi- mum 100 points (which is higher than for all other companies in the benchmark). The Data Protection Award indicator measures the level of data protection within the units on a scale of 0 to 12.

This is how we ensure that climate protection measures are closely connected with our core business. To support the climate strategy and achieve the ambitious Group targets, the national companies have developed and implemented their own climate protection strategies, concepts and measures. These can be viewed in the relevant profiles. Our integrated climate strategy is based on four pillars: Emissions from the value chain; renewable energy; energy efficiency; and enablement: positive climate protection effects for our customers. We have defined objectives and/or key performance indicators for each of the four pillars.

Raising employee awareness Employees also play an important role in reducing our carbon footprint at T-Systems. To this end, T-Systems is reducing business travel and relying on videoconferencing for meetings. In addition, the company¡¯s employees, at all of its production sites, and in all countries in which it is located, are being made more aware of the need to think and act with an orientation to sustainability (the company is doing this, for example, by promoting alternative mobility solutions, participating in ¡°action days¡± focused on sus- tainability, participating in sustainability-oriented workshops, and providing information about ways to reduce power and resources consumption).

Our CEO, along with the other members of the Deutsche Telekom Board of relative to climate-related Management, has responsibility for addressing climate-relevant issues throughout the entire Group. This extends to our opportunities and risks. climate strategy, our climate targets, and our climate-related opportunities and risks. The Deutsche Telekom Board of Management is informed annually, via the Climate Target Monitoring Board Report, concerning the current status of the company¡¯s achievement of its climate targets and regarding other company-relevant climate issues. In addition, climate-protection indicators (ESG KPI img ¡°Energy Intensity¡±, ESG KPI ¡°Carbon Intensity¡±) are included in quarterly reporting to the Management Board member for Human Resources and Legal Affairs, who was the Board member responsible for managing our efforts in connection with CR and climate issues through the end of 2021. As of 2022, the CEO has this responsibility. In addition, Deutsche Telekom¡¯s risk management team reports, on a quarterly basis, to the Supervisory Board¡¯s Audit img Committee regarding ESG risks and opportunities. When unforeseen risks occur outside of the regular-reporting framework, they are reported on an ad hoc basis, and reported to the company¡¯s Board of Management and Supervisory Board.

In addition, we are seeking to reduce our electricity costs. For this reason, we have launched a number of programs for improving energy efficiency at our locations and our plants. In the framework of our environmental program, we have studied our value chain in order to identify potential for enhancing resource efficiency and reducing CO emissions. In the process, a total of ten central action areas for future measures were identified that are expected to make our company¡¯s operations more sustainable overall. The measures include, for example, labelling of products that are especially sustainable.

Screening of media and NGO publications Actively supporting the work of various industry associations that are studying the issue of climate change, such as GeSI, econsense, Foundation 2¡ã, ICC, GSMA, and ETNO Initiating and participating in stakeholder dialogs on the issue of climate change Analyzing responses to the CDP img supply-chain program Analyzing relevant enquiries of rating agencies, such as RobecoSAM img, CDP, Sustainalytics, etc. The process for evaluating the opportunities and risks tied to climate change comprises the following: Identifying and quantifying the important trends Calculating the impacts on operations Analyzing the impacts on the value chain Currently, we are working to financially quantify all of the climate-related opportunities and risks involved. For some opportunities and risks, the quantification has already been completed and is being reported in the CDP questionnaire. The resulting financial impacts are then taken into account in the company¡¯s planning. Management instruments for taking account of climate protection in investment decisions are regularly reviewed for feasibility and benefit (instruments such as an internal CO2 price, for example). On an expert-knowledge basis, opportunities and risks are evaluated in terms of their potential financial impacts (on EBITDA-AL) and of the probability of their occurrence. Where opportunities and risks cannot be quantifed, their potential impacts can be reported in qualitative terms. Once risks and opportunities have been identified, they are analyzed and evaluated, in detail, in terms of the probability of their occurrence and their potential financial impacts. This can be done with the help of a scenario analysis, for example. Then we decide what concrete measures need to be taken in order to reduce the risks or exploit the opportunities. As a next step, in each case the relevant risk owner implements the measures, and monitors and evaluates their effectiveness. As necessary, the above steps are repeated and adjusted in light of the latest pertinent developments and decisions.

The RMP provides methods and systems for identification and evaluation of risks and opportunities. The responsibility for reporting on Group risks and opportunities is divided among the relevant business units; consequently, GCR is responsible for climate risks. Further information on the risk process is available in our annual report.

In various workshops with experts from the areas of technology, procurement, strategy and risk management, we defined the main climate-related opportunities and risks and began weighting them. In the process, we considered the conse- quences, for our business operations, that could result from the physical impacts of progressing climate change. In addition, we analyzed the impacts resulting from political, technological, and social developments tied to the transition toward a low-carbon economy that has been initiated. The important climate-related risks include possible network-infra- structure failures as a result of damage to secondary infrastructure (involving power failures, for example) or failures of cooling sys- tems. Another risk consists of possible network damage or failure as a result of network-infrastructure damage due to climate events or changes in climate conditions. The important climate-related opportunities we have identified include the increasing use of energy-efficient technologies (in net- work operations, for example), and growing demand for climate- friendly products and services.

Among the effects of such breakdowns is their massive impact on the man- agement of rescue operations, for example, sometimes even rendering such emergency efforts entirely impossible. In order to be able to react appropriately in these cases, we have defined the necessary responsibilities, processes, and measures in our internal ¡°Group Policy on Continuity and Situation Management.¡± The policy also outlines how to handle emergency and crisis situations like floods. We also take possible consequences of climate change into account when planning our future business activities. For example, our network infrastructure is set up to be better protected from storm conditions, changes in temperature, and high winds and keep mobile supply infrastructure on hand for emergencies. Financial risks Climate change also carries financial risks ¨C for example, from levies on CO emissions or through increases in energy costs. Our contribution to the mitigation of these risks includes measur- ing our own energy efficiency and developing measures for improvement.

To that end, emis- sions are converted into metric kilotons of CO equivalents (COe). We break down the emissions that occur along our value chain; this gives us an overview of where in the value chain the majority of them occur. By making a complete transition to electricity from renewable energies, we were able to considerably reduce our Scope 2 emis- sions in the year under review. In 2021, market-based Scope 1 and 2 emissions throughout the Group amounted to around 247 000 metric tons of COe, or about 90 percent lower than in the previ- ous year. In 2021, Scope 3 emissions increased in comparison to the previ- ous year ¨C by 13.9 million metric tons, to around 14.8 million met- ric tons of COe. Most of these emissions resulted from the manu- facture of products and components (in particular devices and network technology), and from the use of our products and ser- vices (for example, sold or rented fixed-line and mobile phones, routers, and media receivers) by our customers. We also include emissions resulting from the use of our services by our customers¡¯ own devices, such as laptops or televisions. Emissions from the manufacture and transportation of technology required for estab- lishing our networks are also taken into account. Currently, we are studying various factors that will influence the quantities of our future emissions. Complete-coverage introduc- tion of the Internet Protocol (All-IP), and our suppliers climate-pro- tection efforts, are having a positive impact. In addition, lower power mix factors, and improved energy efficiency in the devices used in connection with our products and services, can be expected to lower emissions. On the other hand, it is possible that the numbers of (new) devices used in connection with our prod- ucts and services will increase. The switch to the new mobile com- munications standard 5G, wider network coverage, and higher- quality fixed lines are also expected to result in emissions increases. ENVIRONMENT 106 CO2e emissions Total COe emissions (Scopes 1 to 3) T-Systems International In addition to discussing the emissions of the Group as a whole, we provide separate information on Scope 1¨C3 emissions for T-Systems International. We present our Scope 1¨C3 greenhouse- gas emissions in a consistent manner, so that they can be com- pared with each other. To that end, emissions are converted into metric kilotons of CO equivalents (COe). We also break down emissions along our value chain. This gives us an overview of where most of the emissions are produced in our value chain. In 2021, market-based Scope 1 and 2 emissions for T-Systems amounted to around 11 000 metric tons of COe. In the same year, the Scope 3 emissions were 285 000 metric tons of COe, thereby accounting for the largest emissions share. Most of these emis- sions occurred in the upstream value chain, as well in our custom- ers¡¯ use of our products and services. In those emissions, we also include emissions resulting from the use of our services by our customers¡¯ own devices, such as laptops or tablet computers.

That¡¯s why the table below contains very detailed information about the Group numbers for the Scope 2 emissions resulting from our electricity consumption. We differentiate between the market-based and location-based methods, thereby adhering to the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance. Market- and location-based emissions are reported in CO equivalents (COe). This change was made in order to allow a transparent comparison between Scope 1 to 3 emissions and to be consistent with the requirements of the Science-Based Targets Initiative, to which the new target is also geared. The leading reporting method is the market-based approach. This method is used to calculate emissions with a specific emissions factor (provider factor) per DT company. This factor depends on a company¡¯s actual energy procurement (electricity mix); procuring renewable energy (direct purchase, certificates) reduces emissions.a) In contrast to the market-based method, with the location-based method the emissions factors for the respective country are used (the country mix factor of the International Energy Agency (IEA)). A company¡¯s actual energy procurement (electricity mix) is hence not taken into account, i.e., not even the procurement of renewable energy over and above the country mix. Change compared to the previous year: The Scope 2 emissions calculated according to the market-based method are about 90 percent lowe than in the previous year. The significant change compared to the previous year results from the Group-wide use of green electricity, PPAs and certificates. Since 2021, we have covered 100 percent of our electricity consumption throughout the Group from renewable sources, thus achieving one of our climate targets. ENVIRONMENT 108 CO2e emissions The graphic presents our Scope 3 emissions from 2019-2021, broken down by emission source. In 2021, upstream emissions accounted for about 38 percent of our Scope 3 emissions, while downstream emissions accounted for about 62 percent.

Our Event Policy specifies the ways in which we offset emissions generated by events. In 2021, we offset over 18 000 metric tons of CO through various measures.

We determine this metric using the method recom- mended by the standard EN50600 for data centers, which has to take the total energy consumed by data centers into account ¨C and not only that used to operate the servers. The PUE factor is calculated using the ratio between the total electrical energy con- sumed by the data center and the amount of electrical energy consumed by IT. In 2021, the global PUE score for our TSystems data centers was 1.58. For our data centers in Germany, we reduced the PUE from 1.85 in 2008 to 1.49 in 2021; this value is significantly below the average for all data centers in Germany, which is around 1.8. Our most-efficient highly available data center has a PUE of 1.3. This will allow us to compensate, in part, for increases in IT systems energy requirements as a result of growing volumes of data and of new features. Data verified by PwC. Data is partly based on estimates, Data centers are becoming more energy-efficient assumptions and projections.

Reporting against standards Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Code TC-TL-130a.1 (Environmental Footprint of Operations) Compliance with the EU Code of Conduct on Data Centre Energy Efficiency The European Union (EU) introduced the ¡°EU Code of Conduct on Data Centre Energy Efficiency¡± in 2008. Its goal is to motivate operators and owners of data centers to reduce energy consump- tion and hence its negative impact on the environment, the econ- omy, and energy supply security. Companies can join this volun- tary initiative, which T-Systems did in 2014.

In determining the amount, the national companies can also include certificates (guarantees of origin) and power purchase agreements (PPAs) for electricity obtained from renewable energy. Deutsche Telekom in Germany purchases its electricity as part of a green tariff. 59 percent comes directly from renewable energies. The rest is covered by guarantees of origin, power purchase agree- ments (PPAs), and a small proportion by in-house generation. T-Mobile US intends to reach our Group target primarily with wind power, but with solar energy as well. To that end, the American national company has concluded long-term contracts (12-15 years) with wind and solar farm operators, which gives the power producers security of investment. Thanks to PPAs, two new wind parks in the United States were put into operation in 2021. We are also aiming to conclude such long-term electricity purchase agreements in other countries. By the end of 2021, 23.1 percent of our electricity was obtained via PPAs. Reporting against standards We use the ESG KPI ¡°Renewable Energy¡± to measure our progress.

As part of this effort, we promote women in STEM subjects and professions (STEM = science, tech- nology, engineering, mathematics). In 2021, for example, we invited female students from around the world to apply for our eighth Womens STEM Award. In addition, we conducted an inno- vation workship in the framework of our partnership with Femtec. Femtec, a cooperative effort being undertaken by major compa- nies, the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, leading German technical uni- versities, and ETH Z¨¹rich, is aimed at finding young female talent for STEM professions and developing it. At the innovation work- shop, a group of nearly 30 scholarship holders developed, over a five-month period, a technically innovative, green solution for smart, energy-autonomous cellular base stations. In addition, we are committed to ¡°Global Digital Women,¡± an international network of women working to increase the percentage of women in digital professions. Social 147 Diversity Percentage of women on the management board In 2020 we achieved the goal of 30 percent women in manage- ment positions. Since November 2020, a third woman has been appointed to the Board of Management. We continue to be at the top of all DAX Groups with a female share of 37.5 percent. Deutsche Telekom is one of the few DAX Groups where women have been part of the Board of Management for several years now. In addition, more and more women are working in international management teams below the Board of Management level. You can find further information in the HR Factbook.

That is why we encourage and support young people from different backgrounds and nationalities. In addition to offering a part-time training program and a part-time dual study program, we also support disadvantaged young people ¨C with an entry- level training internship. Also, school students who have not yet received an apprenticeship position can take part in an internship sponsored by the Federal Employment Agency, and thereby receive the opportunity to become acquainted with an occupation and prepare for regular training in it. The internships run for twelve months, and can in some cases be credited toward a follow-on training program. We also offer young refugees opportunities to take part in entry-level training, regular vocational training or a dual study program. All applicants receive the same opportunities to begin a career with Deutsche Telekom. As of December 31, 2021, 6.52 percent of the apprentices and dual students we employed were of non-German nationality; in total, 49 nations were represented. More diversity and inclusion for T-Mobile US In the fall of 2020, the Board of Directors of our national company in the United States adopted a new declaration of intent for more diversity and inclusion. The declaration of intent was also signed by six major American civil rights organizations with whom T-Mobile US plans more intensive collaboration. To that end, T-Mobile US has established a Diversity and Inclusion Council where each of the signing civil rights organizations has a seat. Other organizations are also involved with the council; a complete list is published on the T-Mobile US website. The Council, which has a total of twelve members, advises T-Mobile US with regard to diversity, equity and inclusion issues. In addition, it assists the company in defining relevant priorities and goals, and it provides support for implementation of the companys strategic diversity plan. The Council convened for the first time in 2020. As of 2021, its meetings take place on a quarterly to semiannual basis. In addition to the new council, T-Mobile US also has an internal Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) network. Participants meet to address current issues, question prejudices, and learn from each other. Tens of thousands of employees ¨C in total, some 36 percent of the companys workforce in the United States ¨C participate in the D&I network. The network includes a group for people with dis- abilities (Accessibility Community), a multicultural group (Multi- cultural Alliance), an intergenerational network (Multigenerational Network), an LGBTQI* community (Pride), a network for veterans and active military personnel (Veterans & Allies Network), and a womens network (Women & Allies Network). T-Mobile US has received a number of awards for its efforts in these areas.

Investments in the capital market made by Deutsche Telekom for company pension schemes and similar obligations in Germany are based on our sustainability principles. These principles were inte- grated into our socially responsible investment strategy for Deutsche Telekom pension providers, which we introduced in 2013, in the form of exclusion criteria. They prohibit investments in companies that produce NBC weapons, anti-personnel mines or cluster bombs or that trade in these or have repeatedly violated the UN Global Compact principles. Deutsche Telekom pension funds are also prohibited from purchasing government securities from governments that are subject to sanctions in accordance with public international law. Our pension providers agreed to our socially responsible investment strategy in 2013. This strategy was reviewed in 2017 and now incorporates Best-in-Class strategies and engagement approaches. We are convinced that putting this strategy into practice will help improve our financial risk indicators. This strategy will also pro- mote perception of Telekom as a socially responsible company. It will help us avoid high-risk, controversial investments and, instead, invest in long-term, stable values that are in line with our principles of sustainability.
