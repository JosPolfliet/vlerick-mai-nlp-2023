Metamaze enables companies to automate large parts of repetitive data entry and validation tasks. \\nBy using Metamaze, companies can \\nautomate 50 to 98% of the manual work. \\nThis leads to\\nimproved employee well-being \\nlower labor costs\\nmore time for value-adding activities\\nthe unlocking of new data and insights\\nAdapts to your process, and your documents \\nAdaptive IDP platforms like Metamaze are flexible systems that adapt to \\nyour process\\n and learn through \\nfully integrated human feedback\\n. Metamaze is not a rigid off-the-shelf ‘one-size fits no-one’ solution. \\nYou can automate any document type you want, including fully custom document types.\\nYou can start from scratch with as little as 10 examples, or start fine-tuning an existing model from our vast library of document types. \\nYou can add your own custom fields to new or existing document types. Metamaze supports all types including simple text, line items, complex hierarchical tables, paragraphs, RegEx, and images.\\nYou can include external data lookup or validation by using data enrichments.\\nYou can customize the pipeline with any custom code. \\nMultilingual by design, with 50+ languages supported.\\nBest-in-class AI technology\\nThe Metamaze Hydra model heavily uses\\n\\u202fpre-trained transformer models. \\nThis technology allows the training and processing of both simple, complex, and fully unstructured documents. You can read more about the latest model architecture \\nhere\\n.\\nWhether you wish to process invoices, purchase orders, complex legal agreements, or any custom document type, Metamaze intelligently interprets documents with a near-human level of precision.\\nBuilt for humans\\nMetamaze is designed to be used by any business user and does not require coding or AI skills to configure, release or maintain.\\nMetamaze is an intuitive platform with a \\nvalidation interface usable by anyone\\n, including non-IT-savvy data entry people.\\nSmart, configurable system to decide when human intervention is required\\nComes with wheels attached: model training, evaluation, version management, deployment, configuration, input/output, user management, … are all built-in. And all of that without the need for any coding or AI skills.\\nBuilt for the enterprise\\nMetamaze is built ground up to support the needs of large and complex organizations. That means\\nEnterprise-level security and compliance. See our \\nTrust Center\\n.\\nAbility to segregate your data, while still having the benefit of sharing models \\nYou can enrich and validate using external data sources like SAP, Dynamics, Salesforce, ...\\nCustomize your pipeline by writing any custom code \\nConnect to REST APIs, Outlook 365, Sharepoint, SFTP, UIPath, BluePrism, or by creating your own using the REST API \\nSupports all common file types and document formats  \\n\\u200b\\nNext\\nHome\\nLast modified \\n4mo ago', metadata={'source': 'https://docs.app.metamaze.eu/', 'title': 'What is Metamaze?'})"

      "Penetration Testing Policy Penetration Testing is a legal, authorized simulated attack performed in order to evaluate the security controls of the Metamaze application and infrastructure and of the Metamaze organization while identifying the exploitable vulnerabilities as well as its strengths, enabling a full risk assessment to be completed. This policy specifies the penetration testing process steps in order to maximise the business value and minimise the security risks. Scope This policy applies throughout the organization and it is particularly relevant to the Engineering department. The objective of the penetration testing is to detect the security weaknesses that could be used by externals to gain unauthorized access to information. The testing will be performed At least on a annual basis When major releases are planned that significantly impact authorization, authentication or data tenancy. In this case, the penetration test should be performed before the release is done do production. The checklist below represents the process steps to be performed by the organization prior to the penetration test. Define scope Define threat model Define testing type: black box, white box, grey box (In a black box penetration test, no information is provided to the tester at all/White box penetration testing involves sharing full network and system information with the tester/In a grey box penetration test only limited information is shared with the tester) Define used methods (external, internal, blind, double-blind, targeted) Contract with 3rd party service for the defined scope and support chosen supplier during execution. Evaluate PEN Test report If vulnerabilities are identified: Identify root cause Define action plan Priority of correction All critical and high risks vulnerabilities must be remediated by 30 days The remediation of medium and low risk vulnerabilities can be planned as part of the overall development backlog, unless it has direct impact to the critical service of customers.\n",
